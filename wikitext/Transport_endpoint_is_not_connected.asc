"Transport endpoint is not connected" is an error from FUSE that
indicates that glusterfs was unable to serve a request for a file.
Glusterfs provides no mechanism for persistent retries of failed
operations (as at version 2.0). A common cause of this error is a
network interruption.

indicates to fix this, umount then mount the failed filesystem.
