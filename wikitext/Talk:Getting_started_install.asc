Outdated & broken links on Install section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As reported in IRC, the install page has download urls pointing to
download.gluster.com and for 3.3.0.

There's been some packaging changes since then for debuntu too so the
instructions may need to be updated a bit.
