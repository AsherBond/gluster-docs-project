To install Gluster Native Client on Debian-based distributions

1.  Install OpenSSH Server on each client using the following command: +
 +
$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server vim wget +
 +
2.  Download the latest GlusterFS .deb file and checksum to each
client. +
 +
You can download the software at http://www.gluster.org/download/. +
 +
3.  For each .deb file, get the checksum (using the following command)
and compare it against the checksum for that file in the md5sum file. +
 +
$ md5sum _GlusterFS_DEB_file_.deb +
 +
The md5sum of the packages is available at:
http://download.gluster.com/pub/gluster/glusterfs. +
 +
4.  Uninstall GlusterFS v3.1 (or an earlier version) from the client
using the following command: +
 +
$ sudo dpkg -r glusterfs +
 +
(Optional) Run $ sudo dpkg -purge glusterfs to purge the configuration
files. +
 +
5.  Install Gluster Native Client on the client using the following
command: +
 +
$ sudo dpkg -i _GlusterFS_DEB_file_ +
 +
For example: +
 +
$ sudo dpkg -i glusterfs-3.2.0.deb +
 +
6.  Ensure that TCP and UDP ports 24007 and 24008 are open on all
Gluster servers. Apart from these ports, you need to open one port for
each brick starting from port 24009. For example: if you have five
bricks, you need to have ports 24009 to 24014 open. +
 +
You can use the following chains with iptables: +
 +
$ sudo iptables -A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p
tcp --dport 24007:24008 -j ACCEPT +
$ sudo iptables -A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p
tcp --dport 24009:24014 -j ACCEPT +
 +
*Note:* If you already have iptable chains, make sure that the above
ACCEPT rules precede the DROP rules. This can be achieved by providing a
lower rule number than the DROP rule. +
 +
