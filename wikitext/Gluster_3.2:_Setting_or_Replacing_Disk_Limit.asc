You can create new directories in your storage environment and set the
disk limit or set disk limit for the existing directories. The directory
name should be relative to the volume with the export directory/mount
being treated as "/". +
 +
'''To set or replace disk limit '''

* Set the disk limit using the following command: +
 +
# gluster volume quota limit-usage /  +
 +
 For example, to set limit on data directory on test-volume where data
is a directory under the export directory: +
 +
# gluster volume quota test-volume limit-usage /data 10GB +
 +
Usage limit has been set on /data +

*Note:* In a multi-level directory hierarchy, the strictest disk limit
will be considered for enforcement.
