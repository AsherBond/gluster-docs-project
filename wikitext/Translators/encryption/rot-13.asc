ROT-13 is a toy translator that can "encrypt" and "decrypt" file
contents using the ROT-13 algorithm. ROT-13 is a trivial algorithm that
rotates each alphabet by thirteen places. Thus, 'A' becomes 'N', 'B'
becomes 'O', and 'Z' becomes 'M'.

It goes without saying that you shouldn't use this translator if you
need _real_ encryption (a future release of GlusterFS will have real
encryption translators).

Example: volume rot-13 type encryption/rot-13 encrypt-write [on|off]
(on) decrypt-read [on|off] (on) subvolumes brick end-volume

* *encrypt-write*

Whether to encrypt on write (default on)

* *decrypt-read*

Whether to decrypt on read (default on)
