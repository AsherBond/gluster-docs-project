Replicate provides RAID-1 like functionality. Replicate keeps files and
directories on all subvolumes in sync. Hence if Replicate has four
subvolumes, there will be four copies of all files and directories. In
case one of the subvolumes goes down (i.e server crash, network
disconnection) Replicate will still service the requests from the
redundant copies.

Replicate also provides self-healing functionality. In case the crashed
servers comes up, the outdated files and directories will be updated
with the latest versions. Replicate uses the extended attributes of the
backend file system to track the pending activities over the files and
directories to provide the self-heal feature.

`volume afr-example` +
`  type cluster/replicate` +
`  subvolumes brick1 brick2 brick3` +
`end-volume`

The above example volfile will replicate all directories and files on
brick1, brick2 and brick3. The subvolumes can be another translator

*NOTE:* Replicate needs *extended attribute* support in the underlying
FS, and also '' 'posix-locks' '' translator over the posix translator.

* *read-subvolume*

The subvolume name on which read operations should be performed on. By
default read operations are balanced across subvolumes.

* *favorite-child*

In the event of a split brain, consider the data or file from
*favorite-child* subvolume to be the master copy while self-healing.

* *data-self-heal*, *metadata-self-heal* and *entry-self-heal*

Enable or disable self healing of file contents, metadata of the files
and directory entries respectively. The default is 'on' for all the
three.

* *data-change-log*, _'metadata-change-log_ and *entry-change-log*

Keep track of transaction log in the extended attributes of the files to
decide reliably the master copy at the time of self-heal. Disabling the
change-log will make Replicate pick a subvolume arbitrarily as the
master copy. Refer link:Understanding AFR Translator[Understanding AFR
Translator] for more details.

* *data-lock-server-count*, *metadata-lock-server-count* and
*entry-lock-server-count*

The number of servers to hold a lock on for each type of operation. The
default is 1 for all the three.

Translator]* to see more volume files, and understand the design.
