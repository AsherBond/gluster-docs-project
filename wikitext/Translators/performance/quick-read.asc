This translator improves performance of read on small files. Over a
posix interface, files are read using the apis open, read and close. For
a filesystem implemented over a network, the round trip overhead of
these calls can be significant. Hence quick-read uses the glusterfs
internal get interface to implement posix abstraction of using
open/read/close for reading of files there by reducing the number of
calls over network from n to 1 where n = no of read calls + 1 (open) + 1
(close).

Example: volume quick-read type performance/quick-read option
cache-timeout nsecs (1 second) option max-file-size nbytes (64Kb)
subvolumes client end-volume

* *cache-timeout*

Timeout for validation of cached file. On timeout stats of the file is
compared with that of cached copy. If the file is found to be changed
after it is cached, the cache is flushed. The default timeout value is 1
second.

* *max-file-size*

Maximum size of the file that can be fetched using get interface. Files
bigger than this are read using the normal open/read/close. Note that
this option controls only how quick-read behaves. Irrespective of the
value this option, the applications running on glusterfs continue to use
the normal open/read/close interface. Default value of this option is 64
kilo bytes.
