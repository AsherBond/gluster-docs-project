It is a translator which caches the dentries and stats read in readdir.
The stats thus stored are used to serve the stat calls from application.
The purpose of this translator is to optimize operations like 'ls -l',
where a readdir is followed by stat calls on each directory entry. The
cache is fd is specific and is flushed on close.

Example: volume stat-prefetch type performance/stat-prefetch subvolumes
client end-volume
