* *root-squashing*

Disables modify permissions for root. This option is similar to NFS root
squashing. By default this is 'off'

* *read-only*

Makes the subvolume a read-only export. All modification operations are
failed with EROFS error. By default this is 'off'

* *fixed-uid* and *fixed-gid*

Make all files and directories appear as if they are owned by the UID
and GID specified with these options

* *translate-uid* and *translate-gid*

Perform operations on behalf of another UID or GID. Multiple UIDs and
GIDs can be translated into a single UID and GID.

* *filter-uid* and *filter-gid*

Fail operations happening from the specified UID and GID with EPERM
error.
