How do I debug GlusterFS?
-------------------------

GlusterFS debug/trace translator when enabled provides a very detailed
log of all internal operations with a complete decoding of values. If
you still can't locate the bug, you can try GNU gdb to debug GlusterFS
code like any other application. GlusterFS runs entirely in user-space.
