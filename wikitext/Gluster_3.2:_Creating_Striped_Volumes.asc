Gluster 3.2: Creating Distributed Striped Volumes[ Creating Distributed
Striped Volumes>>]

Stripes data across bricks in the volume. For best results, you should
use striped volumes only in high concurrency environments accessing very
large files.

'''To configure a striped volume '''

1.  Create a trusted storage pool consisting of the storage servers that
will comprise the volume. +
 For more information, see
Gluster 3.2: Adding Servers to Trusted Storage Pool[ Adding Servers to
Trusted Storage Pool]. +
 +
2.  Create the volume using the following command: +
 +
*Note:* The number of bricks should be a equal to the stripe count for a
striped volume. +
 +
# gluster volume create NEW-VOLNAME [stripe COUNT] [transport tcp | rdma
| tcp,rdma] NEW-BRICK... +
 +
 For example, to create a striped volume across two storage servers: +
 +
# gluster volume create test-volume stripe 2 transport tcp server1:/exp1
server2:/exp2 +
Creation of test-volume has been successful +
Please start the volume to access data. +
 +
3.  (Optional) Set additional options if required, such as auth.allow or
auth.reject. +
 +
For example: +
 +
# gluster volume set test-volume auth.allow 10.* +
 +
*Note:* Make sure you start your volumes before you try to mount them or
else client operations after the mount will hang, see Starting Volumes
for details. +
