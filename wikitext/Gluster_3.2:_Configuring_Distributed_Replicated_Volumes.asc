Distributed replicated volumes replicate (mirror) data across two or
more nodes in the cluster. You can use distributed replicated volumes in
environments where high-availability and high-reliability are critical.
Distributed replicated volumes also offer improved read performance in
most environments.

*To configure a distributed replicated volume*

1.  Create a trusted storage pool consisting of the storage servers that
will comprise the volume.

For more information, see Gluster 3.2: Creating Trusted Storage Pools[
Creating Trusted Storage Pools].

Create the volume using the following command:

*NOTE:* The number of bricks should be a multiple of the replica count
for a distributed replicated volume. Also, the order in which bricks are
specified has a great effect on data protection. Each _replica_count_
consecutive bricks in the list you give will form a replica set, with
all replica sets combined into a volume-wide distribute set. To make
sure that replica-set members are not placed on the same node, list the
first brick on every server, then the second brick on every server in
the same order, etc.

`# gluster volume create `_`NEW-VOLNAME`_` [replica `_`COUNT`_`] [transport tcp | rdma | tcp,rdma] `_`NEW-BRICK...`_

For example, to create a pure replicated volume with two storage
servers: # gluster volume create test-volume replica 2 transport tcp
server1:/exp1 server2:/exp2 Creation of volume replicate has been
successful

To create a four node distributed (replicated) volume with a two-way
mirror: # gluster volume create test-volume replica 2 transport tcp
server1:/exp1 server2:/exp2 server3:/exp3 server4:/exp4 Creation of
volume replicate has been successful

To create a six node distributed (replicated) volume with a two-way
mirror: # gluster volume create test-volume replica 2 transport tcp
server1:/exp1 server2:/exp2 server3:/exp3 server4:/exp4 server5:/exp5
server6:/exp6 Creation of volume replicate has been successful

(Optional) Set additional Gluster_3.2:_Setting_Volume_Options[ options]
if required, such as auth.allow or auth.reject.

For example:

`# gluster volume set test-volume auth.allow 10.*`

Start the volume using the following command:

`# gluster volume start `_`VOLNAME`_

For example: # gluster volume start test-volume Starting volume
test-volume has been successful
