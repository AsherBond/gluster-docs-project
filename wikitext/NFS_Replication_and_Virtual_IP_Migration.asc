How Virtual IP Migration works with GlusterFS NFS and a replicated
volume
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given this simple setup, where a client is connected via NFS to
Server_A, the client communicates with a glusterfs client that's
designed to be an nfs server. This client loads a "vol" file with a
specific nfs translator in order to accomplish this. The rest of that
"vol" file works exactly like the FUSE client in that it connects via
the distribute and replicate or stripe translators to the bricks via the
servers.

If the virtual IP migrates, there is no change in the behavior of the
GlusterFS volume:

If this VIP migration occurs due to a failure of Server_A, the replicate
translator will continue to operate and serve files for both read and
write. When Server_A comes back up, the normal
Gluster_3.1:_Triggering_Self-Heal_on_Replicate[repair] process will
cause the out-of-sync brick to be healed.
