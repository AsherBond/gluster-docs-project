Each commit should be a logical change. Do not mix multiple fixes in the
same commit. While modifying a file, coding standard fixes and logical
changes should be submitted separately.

Every submitted patch should undergo a stringent review session. Review
comments by other developers are made by replying to the email. For a
patch to make it through, there must be atleast one response which
accepts the patch and no response which rejects or asks for changes.

To resubmit a patch, changes can be done in the codebase and an
amendment should be done to the previous commit.

`sh$ ./commit.sh --amend`

Fresh patches have to be generated and mailed as described in
http://www.gluster.com/community/documentation/index.php/Publishing[Publishing]
section.

Accepted patches will be signed off by the maintainer and pushed to the
glusterfs repository, which in turn will be available to others via 'git
pull'.
