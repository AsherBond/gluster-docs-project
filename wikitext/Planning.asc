Plotting the Gluster (R)evolution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Want to get involved? We're setting up a regular date and time, every
week, where we can discuss the direction of the Gluster community and
associated projects.

* link:GlusterMeeting[Meeting Agenda / Minutes]

This page will serve as the home for planning new or modified features
for gluster.org. We're looking to make gluster.org into a clearing house
for all projects related to GlusterFS: integrations with other tools,
translators, language bindings, etc. Whether you're a new user, a
budding developer, or an old hand, we want this community to evolve to
serve your needs. See below for specifics.

Releases
~~~~~~~~

Plan out each release cycle, starting with GlusterFS 3.4

Gluster.org infrastructure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are some ideas for what we're thinking:

* New CMS - we're discovering that Wordpress seems to have limitations
for a full-fledged CMS. Let's discuss the needed changes, such as an
integrated wiki, and the ability to have multiple contributors to
different sections
* Project management - Want to start a project on gluster.org? Let's
give you the tools needed, such as hooks into github or other
repository, a bug tracker (or hooks to another one), wiki, docs area,
membership, etc.
* Q&A - we like Q&A tools, such as what we have now on
community.gluster.org, but we're not sure if we have the right tool.
Suggestions welcome.

GlusterFS Build, Test and Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We want GlusterFS to be the most robust distributed filesystem on the
planet. As such, we're looking for people who want to test GlusterFS at
scale, or can pitch in and help prepare for releases. If you understand
packaging, we need your help. If you can test at scale, even better.
