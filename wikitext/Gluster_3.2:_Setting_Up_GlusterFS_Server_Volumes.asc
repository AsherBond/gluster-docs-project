Gluster 3.2: Creating Distributed Volumes[ Creating Distributed
Volumes>>]

A volume is a logical collection of bricks where each brick is an export
directory on a server in the trusted storage pool. Most of the gluster
management operations happen on the volume.

You can create new volumes in your storage environment, as needed. When
creating a new volume, you must specify the bricks that comprise the
volume.

'''To create a new volume '''

* Create the new volume using the following command: +
 +
# gluster volume create NEW-VOLNAME [stripe COUNT | replica COUNT]
[transport ] NEW-BRICK1 NEW-BRICK2 NEW-BRICK3... +
 +
For example, to create test-volume consisting of server3:/exp3 and
server4:/exp4: +
 +
# gluster volume create test-volume server3:/exp3 server4:/exp4 +
Creation of test-volume has been successful +
Please start the volume to access data.

Volumes of the following types can be created in your storage
environment:

* Distributed - Distributes files throughout the bricks in the volume.
For more information, see Gluster 3.2: Creating Distributed Volumes[
Creating Distributed Volumes].

* Replicated – Replicates files across bricks in the volume. For more
information, see Gluster 3.2: Creating Replicated Volumes[ Creating
Replicated Volumes].

* Striped – Stripes data across bricks in the volume. For more
information, see Gluster 3.2: Creating Striped Volumes[ Creating Striped
Volumes].

* Distributed Striped - Distributes data across striped bricks in the
volume. For more information, see
Gluster 3.2: Creating Distributed Striped Volumes[ Creating Distributed
Striped Volumes].

* Distributed Replicated - Distributes files across replicated bricks in
the volume. For more information, see
Gluster 3.2: Creating Distributed Replicated Volumes[ Creating
Distributed Replicated Volumes].
