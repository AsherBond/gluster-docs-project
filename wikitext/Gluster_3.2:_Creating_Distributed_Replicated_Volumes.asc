Gluster 3.2: Starting Volumes[ Starting Volumes>>]

Distributes files across replicated bricks in the volume. You can use
distributed replicated volumes in environments where the requirement is
to scale storage and high-reliability is critical. Distributed
replicated volumes also offer improved read performance in most
environments.

'''To configure a distributed replicated volume '''

1.  Create a trusted storage pool consisting of the storage servers that
will comprise the volume. +
 For more information, see
Gluster 3.2: Adding Servers to Trusted Storage Pool[ Adding Servers to
Trusted Storage Pool]. +
 +
2.  Create the volume using the following command: +
 +
'''Note:The number of bricks should be a multiple of the replica count
for a distributed replicated volume. Also, the order in which bricks are
specified has a great effect on data protection. Each replica_count
consecutive bricks in the list you give will form a replica set, with
all replica sets combined into a volume-wide distribute set. To make
sure that replica-set members are not placed on the same node, list the
first brick on every server, then the second brick on every server in
the same order, and so on. +
 +
# gluster volume create NEW-VOLNAME [replica COUNT] [transport tcp |
rdma | tcp,rdma] NEW-BRICK... +
 +
 To create a four node distributed (replicated) volume with a two-way
mirror: +
 +
# gluster volume create test-volume replica 2 transport tcp
server1:/exp1 server2:/exp2 server3:/exp3 server4:/exp4 +
Creation of test-volume has been successful +
Please start the volume to access data. +
 +
To create a distributed six node distributed (replicated) volume with a
two-way mirror: +
 +
# gluster volume create test-volume replica 2 transport tcp
server1:/exp1 server2:/exp2 server3:/exp3 server4:/exp4 server5:/exp5
server6:/exp6 +
Creation of test-volume has been successful +
Please start the volume to access data. +
 +
3.  (Optional) Set additional options if required, such as auth.allow or
auth.reject. +
 +
For example: +
 +
# gluster volume set test-volume auth.allow 10.* +
 +
*Note:* Make sure you start your volumes before you try to mount them or
else client operations after the mount will hang, see Starting Volumes
for details. +
