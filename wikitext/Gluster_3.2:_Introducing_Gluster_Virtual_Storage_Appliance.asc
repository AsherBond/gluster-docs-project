The Gluster Virtual Storage Appliance enables you to rapidly deploy
Gluster storage, running as a virtual machine on any one of the hosts
like ESX or ESXi, XenServer, or GNU/Linux KVM in your environment. Using
Gluster Virtual Storage Appliance, you can add and remove nodes as
required to match the evolving needs of your organization.

*Introducing Gluster*

Gluster is an open source, scale-out file system capable of scaling to
several petabytes and handling thousands of clients. Gluster assembles
storage building blocks, aggregating disk and memory resources and
managing data in a single global namespace. Gluster is based on a
stackable user space design and can deliver exceptional performance for
diverse workloads.

The Gluster modular architecture allows administrators to stack modules
to match user requirements, as needed. For example, administrators can
use Gluster to quickly configure a standalone server system and later
expand the system as needs grow.

*Virtualized Cloud Environments*

Gluster is designed for today's high-performance, virtualized cloud
environments. Unlike traditional data centers, cloud environments
require multi-tenancy along with the ability to grow or shrink resources
on demand. Gluster incorporates cloud capabilities into the core
architecture.

Every module in Gluster is treated as a volume. Gluster further adds an
elastic volume manager (the glusterd daemon) and a console manager (the
gluster command line interface). Using the console manager,
administrators can dynamically expand, shrink, rebalance, and migrate
volumes, among other operations. The command line interface additionally
provides an interactive shell (with auto-completion) along with
scripting capabilities suitable for automation.
