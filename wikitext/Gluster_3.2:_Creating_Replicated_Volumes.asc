Replicated volumes replicate files throughout the bricks in the volume.
You can use replicated volumes in environments where high-availability
and high-reliability are critical.

'''To configure a replicated volume '''

1.  Create a trusted storage pool consisting of the storage servers that
will comprise the volume. +
 For more information, see
Gluster 3.2: Adding Servers to Trusted Storage Pool[ Adding Servers to
Trusted Storage Pool]. +
2.  Create the volume using the following command: +
 +
*Note:* The number of bricks should be equal to of the replica count for
a replicated volume. +
 To protect against server and disk failures, it is recommended that the
bricks of the volume are from different servers. +
 +
# gluster volume create NEW-VOLNAME [replica COUNT] [transport tcp |
rdma | tcp,rdma] NEW-BRICK... +
 +
 For example, to create a replicated volume with two storage servers: +
 +
# gluster volume create test-volume replica 2 transport tcp
server1:/exp1 server2:/exp2 +
Creation of test-volume has been successful +
Please start the volume to access data. +
 +
3.  (Optional) Set additional options if required, such as auth.allow or
auth.reject. +
 +
For example: +
 +
# gluster volume set test-volume auth.allow 10.* +
 +
*Note:* Make sure you start your volumes before you try to mount them or
else client operations after the mount will hang, see Starting Volumes
for details. +
