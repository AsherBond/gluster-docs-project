Other than the feature sets, performance enhancements, correctness, one
of the main difference you will notice is that some of your volume
specfiles may not work fine with 1.4 release. Here is the list of what
all changed in 1.4

[[]]
Server protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

_option auth.ip.brick.allow *_ need to be changed to *_option
auth.addr.brick.allow *_* (notice the change from *ip* to *addr*)

[[]]
Transport
~~~~~~~~~

Now, we don't differentiate transport code based on client and server
like 1.3 (where you used _option transport-type tcp/client_ etc). Now
officially we provide two transports *socket* and *ib-verbs* . Though
different address-families are supported. like *inet*, *unix*, *inet6*,
*ib-sdp*.

So now on your protocol volume will look (on both client and server
volumes)

`option transport-type socket` +
`option address-family inet`

or option transport-type ib-verbs

*NOTE:* for backward compatibility we have provided options
_transport-type tcp_, _transport-type ib-sdp_, _transport-type unix_.
But preferred method will be to use *socket* directly with proper
_address-family_ option. Also note that there is no */server* or
*/client* component with transport options.

[[]]
unify self-heal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unify self-heal now supports options *off*, *background*, and
*foreground* only. By default the option will be _foreground_

[[]]
stripe block-size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now stripe doesn't work based on pattern. All the pattern specific
things has to be decided by _switch_ translator. So, _option block-size_
takes just numbers (in block-size, which may be in form 1024, 1MB,
128kb).

[[]]
Strict type check
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GlusterFS won't start unless you have a proper volume specfile to start
now. We are trying to enhance parsing so that it will tell the user what
is the exact error in specfile.

Sorry for the inconvenience caused.
