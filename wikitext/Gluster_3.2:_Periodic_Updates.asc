Gluster strongly recommends you to update your Gluster Storage Software
Appliance on a regular basis with the latest security patches and
upgrades. This will ensure that your computer is up-to-date with
security updates and upgrades.

 +
Note: Downloading base-3.2-repo file is a one-time effort. +
 +
2.  Run the following command to clear yum caches: +
# yum clean all +
 +
3.  Install the periodic updates using the following command: +
# yum update +
 +
4.  Restart glusterd using the following command: +
