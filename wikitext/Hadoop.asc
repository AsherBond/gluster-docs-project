Hadoop - GlusterFS Resource Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

http://hadoop.apache.org/[Hadoop] (or the "Apache Hadoop software
library" as it's officially called) is a framework that allows for the
distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers
using a simple programming model. It is designed to scale up from single
servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and
storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-avaiability, the
library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the
application layer, so delivering a highly-availabile service on top of a
cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.

One of the pieces that hampers Hadoop's scale-out capabilities is the
storage backend. HDFS is the filesystem used to store Hadoop data, and
by default, it needs at least 3 nodes to replicate data. HDFS also has
some limitations when it comes to the amount of storage and the total
number of storage nodes it can utilize.

With the GlusterFS connector, not only can it scale-out beyond HDFS, it
also can reduce the number of nodes. GlusterFS replication can happen on
just 2 nodes as a minimum, just as HDFS can be configured to replicate
to only 2 nodes.

The Gluster Connector for Hadoop will be available in
link:3.3beta[GlusterFS 3.3 beta].
