Distributed volumes distribute files throughout the cluster. You can use
distributed volumes to scale storage in an archival environment in
situations where small periods of down time is acceptable during disk
swaps.

*Note:* Disk failure in distributed volumes can result in a serious loss
of data since directory contents are spread randomly throughout the
cluster.

*To configure a distributed volume*

1.  Create a trusted storage pool consisting of the storage servers that
will comprise the volume.

For more information, see Gluster 3.2: Creating Trusted Storage Pools[
Creating Trusted Storage Pools].

Create the volume using the following command:

`# gluster volume create `_`NEW-VOLNAME`_` [transport tcp | rdma | tcp,rdma] `_`NEW-BRICK...`_

For example, to create a distributed volume with four storage servers: #
gluster volume create test-volume transport tcp server1:/exp1
server2:/exp2 server3:/exp3 server4:/exp4 Creation of volume distribute
has been successful

You can optionally display the volume information using the following
command: # gluster volume info Volume Name: test-volume Type: None
Status: Created Number of Bricks: 4 Bricks: Brick1: server1:/exp1
Brick2: server2:/exp2 Brick3: server3:/exp3 Brick4: server4:/exp4

To create a distributed volume with four storage servers over
InfiniBand: # gluster volume create test-volume transport rdma
server1:/exp1 server2:/exp2 server3:/exp3 server4:/exp4 Creation of
volume distribute has been successful

(Optional) Set additional Gluster_3.2:_Setting_Volume_Options[ options]
if required, such as auth.allow or auth.reject.

For example:

`# gluster volume set test-volume auth.allow 10.*`

Start the volume using the following command:

`# gluster volume start `_`VOLNAME`_

For example: # gluster volume start test-volume Starting volume
test-volume has been successful

(Optional) Display the volume information again to confirm that the
volume has started using the following command:

`# gluster volume info` +
`Volume Name: test-volume` +
`Type: None` +
`Status: Started` +
`Number of Bricks: 4` +
`Bricks:` +
`Brick1: server1:/exp1` +
`Brick2: server2:/exp2` +
`Brick3: server3:/exp3` +
`Brick4: server4:/exp4`
