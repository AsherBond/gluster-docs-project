You can set volume options, as needed, while the cluster is online and
available.

*To set volume options*

* Set volume options using the following command: +

The following table lists the Volume options along with its description
and default value:

Note: The default options given here are hard coded in the source file
and is subject to modification at any given time. The following default
values may not be the same for all versions.

[cols=",,",]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Description |Default Value

|[multiblock cell omitted] |Specifies the number of maximum number
blocks per file for which self-heal process would be applied
simultaneously. |16

|[multiblock cell omitted] |[multiblock cell omitted] |reset

|[multiblock cell omitted] |Specified the percentage of disk space that
must be kept free. Might be useful for non-uniform bricks. |0%

|[multiblock cell omitted] |Specifies the size of the stripe unit that
will read from or written to the striped servers. Optionally different
stripe unit sizes can be specified for different files, with the
following pattern . |128 KB (for all files)

|cluster.quorum-type |cluster.quorum-count]]. If quorum is not met, then
modifing operations such as _write_ will fail with EROFS. This prevents
most cases of "split brain" which result from conflicting writes to
different bricks. |None

|cluster.quorum-count |cluster.quorum-type]]. This value is not used
unless _cluster.quorum-type_ is "fixed". |0

|[multiblock cell omitted] |Changes the log-level of the bricks. |INFO

|[multiblock cell omitted] |Changes the log-level of the clients. |INFO

|[multiblock cell omitted] |Sets the maximum file size cached by the
io-cache translator. Can use the normal size descriptors of KB,MB,GB,TB
or PB (ie. 6GB). Maximum size uint64. |18,446,744,073,709,551,615B

|[multiblock cell omitted] |Sets the minimum file size cached by the
io-cache translator. Same as "max" above. |0B

|[multiblock cell omitted] |The cached data for a file will be retained
till 'cache-refresh-timeout' seconds, after which data re-validation is
performed. |1 sec

|[multiblock cell omitted] |The time frame after which the operation has
to be declared as dead, if the server does not respond for a particular
operation. |1800 (30 mins)

|[multiblock cell omitted] |[multiblock cell omitted] |42 sec

|[multiblock cell omitted] |'IP addresses/Host name' of the clients
which should be allowed to access the the volume.
|[multiblock cell omitted]

|[multiblock cell omitted] |'IP addresses/Host name' of the clients
which should be denied to access the volume. |NONE (reject none)

|[multiblock cell omitted] |Size of the read cache. |32 MB

|[multiblock cell omitted] |Size of the per-file write-behind buffer. |1
MB

|[multiblock cell omitted] |The number of threads in IO threads
translator. |16

|[multiblock cell omitted] |If this option is set ON, instructs
write-behind translator to perform flush in background, by returning
success (or any errors, if any of previous writes were failed) to
application even before flush is sent to backend filesystem. By default,
this option is on. |ON

|[multiblock cell omitted] |Statistics related to the latency of each
operation would be tracked inside GlusterFS data-structures. |off

|[multiblock cell omitted] |Statistics related to file-operations would
be tracked inside GlusterFS data-structures. |off

|[multiblock cell omitted] |Turn-off export of volume through NFS |off

|[multiblock cell omitted] |[multiblock cell omitted] |off

|[multiblock cell omitted] |Set the access type for the specified
sub-volume. |read-write

|[multiblock cell omitted] |If there is an UNSTABLE write from the
client, STABLE flag will be returned to force the client to not to send
a COMMIT request. +
 +
In some environments, combined with a replicated GlusterFS setup, this
option can improve write performance. This flag allows users to trust
Gluster replication logic to sync data to the disks and recover when
required. COMMIT requests if received will be handled in a default
manner by fsyncing. STABLE writes are still handled in a sync manner.
|off

|[multiblock cell omitted] |All writes and COMMIT requests are treated
as async. This implies that no write requests are guaranteed to be on
server disks when the write reply is received at the NFS client. Trusted
sync includes trusted-write behavior. |off

|[multiblock cell omitted] |By default, all sub-volumes of NFS are
exported as individual exports. Now, this option allows you to export
only the specified subdirectory or subdirectories in the volume. This
option can also be used in conjunction with nfs3.export-volumes option
to restrict exports only to the subdirectories specified through this
option. You must provide an absolute path. |Enabled for all sub
directories.

|[multiblock cell omitted] |Enable/Disable exporting entire volumes,
instead if used in conjunction with nfs3.export-dir, can allow setting
up only subdirectories as exports. |on

|[multiblock cell omitted] |Enable/Disable the AUTH_UNIX authentication
type. You must enable this option for better interoperability. However,
you can disable it if required. |on

|[multiblock cell omitted] |Enable/Disable the AUTH_NULL authentication
type. You must always enable this option. |on

|[multiblock cell omitted] |Allow a comma separated list of addresses
and/or hostnames to connect to the server. By default, all clients are
disallowed. This allows you to define a general rule for all exported
volumes. |Reject All

|[multiblock cell omitted] |Reject a comma separated list of addresses
and/or hostnames from connecting to the server. By default, all
connections are disallowed. This allows you to define a general rule for
all exported volumes. |Reject All

|[multiblock cell omitted] |Allow client connections from unprivileged
ports. By default only privileged ports are allowed. This is a global
setting in case insecure ports are to be enabled for all exports using a
single option. |off

|[multiblock cell omitted] |Allow client connections from unprivileged
ports. By default only privileged ports are allowed. This is a global
setting in case insecure ports are to be enabled for all exports using a
single option. |on

|[multiblock cell omitted] |Turn-off name lookup for incoming client
connections using this option. In some setups, the name server can take
too long to reply to DNS queries resulting in timeouts of mount
requests. Use this option to turn off name lookups during address
authentication. Note, turning this off will prevent you from using
hostnames in rpc-auth.addr.* filters. |on

|[multiblock cell omitted] |For NFS clients or apps that do not support
64-bit inode numbers, use this option to make NFS return 32-bit inode
numbers instead. Disabled by default so NFS returns 64-bit inode numbers
by default. |off

|[multiblock cell omitted] |For systems that need to run multiple NFS
servers, you need to prevent more than one from registering with portmap
service. Use this option to turn off portmap registration for Gluster
NFS. |on

|[multiblock cell omitted] |Use this option on systems that need Gluster
NFS to be associated with a non-default port number. |38465- 38467

|[multiblock cell omitted] |Use this option to automatically sync the
changes in the filesystem from Master to Slave. |off

|[multiblock cell omitted] |For performance reasons, quota caches the
directory sizes on client. You can set timeout indicating the maximum
duration of directory sizes in cache, from the time they are populated,
during which they are considered valid. . |0
