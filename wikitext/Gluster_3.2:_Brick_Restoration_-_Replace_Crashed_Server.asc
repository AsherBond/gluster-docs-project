This procedure is for replacing a failed server, IF your newly installed
server has the same hostname as the failed one:

(If your new server will have a different hostname, see
http://community.gluster.org/q/a-replica-node-has-failed-completely-and-must-be-replaced-with-new-empty-hardware-how-do-i-add-the-new-hardware-and-bricks-back-into-the-replica-pair-and-begin-the-healing-process/[this
article] instead.)

For purposes of this example, the server that crashed will be _server3_
and the other servers will be _server1_ and _server2_

1.  On both server1 and server2, make sure hostname server3 resolves to
the correct IP address of the new replacement server.
2.  On either server1 or server2, do
+
----------------------------------
grep server3 /etc/glusterd/peers/*
----------------------------------
+
This will return a uuid followed by ":hostname1=server3"
3.  On server3, make sure glusterd is stopped, then do
+
---------------------------------------------------------------
echo UUID={uuid from previous step}>/etc/glusterd/glusterd.info
---------------------------------------------------------------
4.  On server3:
* make sure that all brick directories are created/mounted
* start glusterd
* peer probe one of the existing servers
* restart glusterd, check that full peer list has been populated using
+
-------------------
gluster peer status
-------------------
* (if peers are missing, probe them explicitly, then restart glusterd
again)
* check that full volume configuration has been populated using
+
-------------------
gluster volume info
-------------------
* if volume configuration is missing, do +
+
-------------------------------
gluster volume sync server1 all
-------------------------------
+
+
+
restart glusterd

This will restore the configuration for this server.

Follow this procedure by Gluster_3.2: Triggering Self-Heal on Replicate[
Triggering Self-Heal on Replicate]

Or if the failed server only hosted a fraction of the whole volume, you
could use
