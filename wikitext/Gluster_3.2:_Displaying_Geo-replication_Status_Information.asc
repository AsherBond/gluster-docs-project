You can display status information about a specific geo-replication
master session, or a particular master-slave session, or all
geo-replication sessions, as needed. +
 +
*To display geo-replication status information* +
 +
* Display information of all geo-replication sessions using the
following command: +
 +
# gluster volume geo-replication status +
 +
* Display information of a particular master slave session using the
following command: +
 +
# gluster volume geo-replication _MASTER_ _SLAVE_ status +
 +
For example, to display information of Volume1 and
example.com:/data/remote_dir +
 +
# gluster volume geo-replication Volume1 example.com:/data/remote_dir
status +
 +
The status of the geo-replication between Volume1 and
example.com:/data/remote_dir is displayed. +
 +
* Display information of all geo-replication sessions belonging to a
master +
 +
# gluster volume geo-replication _MASTER_ status +
 +
For example, to display information of Volume1 +
 +
# gluster volume geo-replication Volume1 status +
 +
\{| border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" |MASTER |SLAVE |STATUS |-
|______ |_____________________________________________________ |______
|- |Volume1 |ssh://root@example.com:gluster://127.0.0.1:remove_volume
|OK |- |Volume1 |ssh://root@example.com: file:///data/remote_dir |OK |-

|}

The status of a session could be one of the following:

* *Starting:* This is the initial phase of the Geo-replication session;
it remains in this state for a minute, to make sure no abnormalities are
present.

* *OK*: The geo-replication session is in a stable state.

* *Faulty*: The geo-replication session has witnessed some abnormality
and the situation has to be investigated further. For further
information, see
Gluster 3.2: Troubleshooting Geo-replication[Troubleshooting] section.

* *Corrupt*: The monitor thread which is monitoring the geo-replication
session has died. This situation should not occur normally, if it
persists contact Gluster
