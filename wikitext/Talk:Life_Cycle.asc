I'd like to add two more points related to how these releases happen.

* Each GlusterFS release should have a "czar" designated by the Advisory
Board.

* The Advisory Board has go/no-go votes on release finality, much like
the Fedora model.

"Advisory Board" could be replaced by any other group, except that the
AB is the only group that we have handy right now. The important thing
is that gluster.org release decisions should be separate from Red Hat
release decisions, and not driven by procedures or concerns peculiar to
Red Hat.
