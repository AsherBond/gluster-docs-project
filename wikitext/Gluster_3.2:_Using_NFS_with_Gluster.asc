Gluster 3.2: Using NFS to Mount Volumes[ Using NFS to Mount Volumes >>]

This guide describes how to use NFS to mount Gluster volumes (both
manually and automatically) and how to test to verify that the volume
has mounted successfully.

Using a platform's native NFS client will result in best performance
when reading many small files (web serving). However, no automatic
fail-over will happen in case of brick failure.

Note: NFS should not be used to support the lock volume used by CTDB as
NFS does not currently support locking. Instead, use the Gluster native
mount.

You can disable the NFS client with:

` gluster volume set `` nfs.disable on`

Or re-enable it with

` gluster volume set `` nfs.disable off`
