*To install Gluster Storage Software Appliance through booting from PXE,
perform the following steps:*

1.  Copy the content of the installation media to a directory or mount
the installation media to a directory on a provisioning/imaging server.
This directory will be used as network share by NFS, HTTP or FTP. +
 +
For example, to export through NFS, add the following line in
/etc/exports file:<br/> +
_/mnt *(ro, sync, no_root_squash)_ +
 +
2.  Prepare a kick-start file by using _template-net-ks.cfg_ file as
template from the installation media. Add the installation method to the
kickstart file. +
 +
For information on kickstart options, see
http://www.centos.org/docs/5/html/Installation_Guide-en-US/s1-kickstart2-options.html. +
 +
For example, for NFS method, add the following line: +
 +
nfs _--server=192.168.122.1 --dir=/mnt_ +
 +
3.  Prepare _tftpboot_ settings on existing tftp server by performing
the following: +
 +
# Copy _initrd.img_ and _vmlinuz_ files from _/images/pxeboot/_
directory of the installation media to tftpboot directory. +
 +
# Add a new entry in existing pxelinux configuration file for copied
vmlinuz and initrd.img files. +
 +
An example entry in existing pxelinux configuration file:<br/> +
 _LABEL gluster_ +
 +
_kernel vmlinuz_ +
 +
_append initrd=initrd.img ksdevice=eth0_ +
 +
_ks=nfs: 192.168.122.1:/home/Joseph/template -net-ks.cfg_ +
 +
4.  Network boot the machine in which you want to install Gluster
Software Storage Appliance. +
 +
5.  During network boot to start the installation, type/choose the name
added in pxelinux configuration file. In the above example, it is
‘gluster’. +
 +
 After booting, logon to the server using the following credentials: +
 +
*Username:* root +
 +
*Password:* syst3m +
 +
