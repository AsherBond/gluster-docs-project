To ensure that a patch applies cleanly against the mainline repository,
it is best to follow this procedure.

* Create a branch for whatever you're working on

`sh$ git branch big-feature` +
`sh$ git checkout big-feature`

`sh$ git rebase master`

This step will pull all changes that have been made since the branch
diverged. If there are any conflicts, git will leave conflict markers
("<<<<") and you should resolve it manually and then run "git rebase
--continue".

`sh$ ./format-patch.sh -n -3`

And thus clean and neatly applicable patches are ready.
