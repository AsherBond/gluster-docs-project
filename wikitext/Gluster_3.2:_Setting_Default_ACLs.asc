Gluster 3.2: Retrieving POSIX ACLs[ Retrieving POSIX ACLs>>]

You can apply default ACLs only to directories. They determine the
permissions of a file system objects that inherits from its parent
directory when it is created.

* To set default ACLs, use the following command: +
 +
# setfacl –m –-set  +
 +
For example, to set the default ACLs for the /data directory to read for
users not in the user group: +
 +
# setfacl –m --set o::r /mnt/gluster/data

*Note:* An access ACLs set for an individual file can override the
default ACLs permissions.

*Effects of a Default ACLs*

The following are the ways in which the permissions of a directory's
default ACLs are passed to the files and subdirectories in it:

* A subdirectory inherits the default ACLs of the parent directory both
as its default ACLs and as an access ACLs.
* A file inherits the default ACLs as its access ACLs.
