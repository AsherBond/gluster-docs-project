Before configuring a GlusterFS volume, you need to create a trusted
storage pool consisting of the storage servers that will comprise the
volume.

A storage pool is a trusted network of storage servers. When you start
the first server, the storage pool consists of that server alone. To add
additional storage servers to the storage pool, you can use the probe
command from a storage server that is already trusted.

*Note:* The GlusterFS service must be running on all storage servers
that you want to add to the storage pool. See
Gluster 3.2: Starting the glusterd Daemon[ Starting the GlusterFS
Service] for more information. +
 *To create a trusted storage pool* +

1.  Probe the servers you want to add to the storage pool. +
 +
To add a server to the storage pool, use the following command: +
 +
# gluster peer probe _SERVER_ +
 +
For example, to create a trusted storage poll of four servers, add three
servers to the storage pool from server1: +
 +
# gluster peer probe server2 +
Probe successful +
# gluster peer probe server3 +
Probe successful +
# gluster peer probe server4 +
Probe successful +
 +
 *Note:* Do not self-probe local host (server 1). +
 +
2.  Verify the peer status from the first server using the following
commands: +
 +
#gluster peer status +
Number of Peers: 3 +
 +
Hostname: 192.168.1.92 +
Uuid: 5e987bda-16dd-43c2-835b-08b7d55e94e5 +
State: Peer in Cluster (Connected) +
 +
Hostname: 192.168.1.93 +
Uuid: 1e0ca3aa-9ef7-4f66-8f15-cbc348f29ff7 +
State: Pfde43e-4533-4e33-4f77-ed3984da21ae +
State: Peer in Cluster (Connected) +
 +

After peer probe, in the remote machine, the peer machine information is
stored with IP address instead of hostname.

*To manager a trusted storage pool* +

1.  Remove a brick from the storage pool with: +
 +
# gluster peer detach _SERVER_ +
 +
 #263A #263A
