There's a bug with archives. My configuration:

brick1 brick2 brick3 in afr1 \ brick4 brick5 brick6 in afr2 \ afr1 afr2
in stripe (1MB block)

fuse 2.7.2gfs8 glusterfs 1.3.7 all from debian pakage:
http://lmello.virt-br.org/debian distr. Ubuntu server 7.10

when i tried to do tar fxvj (or xvj) on linux-.tar.bz2 it causes an
error and created a fake directory that i was unable to delete from
mounted GlusterFS untill i've deleted it in brick's real folders.
however bzip2 -d on linux-.tar.bz2 worked just fine and then tar x on
linux-.tar worked fine too. so i guess that that's an issue in nested
archives only. i'm planning to give this configuration a try in a
production enviroment a bit later. and one more question... can i use
.limits.min-free-disk with a stripe or stripe with schedulers that can
give me a bit more options besides block size? unify is ok when u have a
lot of small files but if u have a lot of large files a stripe is must.
