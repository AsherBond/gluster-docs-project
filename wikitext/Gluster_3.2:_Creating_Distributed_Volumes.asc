Distributed volumes distribute files throughout the bricks in the
volume. You can use distributed volumes where the requirement is to
scale storage and the redundancy is either not important or is provided
by other hardware/software layers.

*Note:* Disk/server failure in distributed volumes can result in a
serious loss of data since directory contents are spread randomly
throughout the bricks in the volume.

*To create a distributed volume*

1.  Create a trusted storage pool consisting of the storage servers that
will comprise the volume.

For more information, see
Gluster 3.2: Adding Servers to Trusted Storage Pool[ Adding Servers to
Trusted Storage Pool] +

Create the volume using the following command:

 +
# gluster volume create _NEW-VOLNAME_ [transport tcp | rdma | tcp,rdma]
_NEW-BRICK..._

For example, to create a distributed volume with four storage servers
using tcp: +
 +
 # gluster volume create test-volume transport tcp server1:/exp1
server2:/exp2 server3:/exp3 server4:/exp4 +
Creation of volume distribute has been successful +
Please start the volume to access data.

You can optionally display the volume information using the following
command: +
# gluster volume info +
Volume Name: test-volume +
Type: Distribute +
Status: Created +
Number of Bricks: 4 +
Transport-type: tcp +
Bricks: +
Brick1: server1:/exp1 +
Brick2: server2:/exp2 +
Brick3: server3:/exp3 +
Brick4: server4:/exp4 +
 +
 To create a distributed volume with four storage servers over
InfiniBand: +
 # gluster volume create test-volume transport rdma server1:/exp1
server2:/exp2 server3:/exp3 server4:/exp4 +
Creation of volume distribute has been successful +
Please start the volume to access data.

(Optional) Set additional Gluster_3.2:_Tuning_Volume_Options[ options]
if required, such as auth.allow or auth.reject.

For example: +
 # gluster volume set test-volume auth.allow 10.*

*Note:* Make sure you start your volumes before you try to mount them or
else client operations after the mount will hang, see
Gluster_3.2:_Tuning_Volume_Options[ Tuning Volume Options] for details.

(Optional) Display the volume information to confirm that the volume has
started using the following command:

 +
# gluster volume info +
Volume Name: test-volume +
Type: Distribute +
Status: Started +
Number of Bricks: 4 +
Transport-type: rdma +
Bricks: +
Brick1: server1:/exp1 +
Brick2: server2:/exp2 +
Brick3: server3:/exp3 +
Brick4: server4:/exp4 +
