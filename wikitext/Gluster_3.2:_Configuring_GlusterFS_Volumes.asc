This section describes how to configure GlusterFS volumes in your
storage environment, using the following common scenarios:

* Distributed - Distributes files throughout the cluster. For more
information, see Gluster 3.2: Configuring Distributed Volumes[
Configuring Distributed Volumes].
* Distributed Replicated - Replicates data across two or more nodes in
the cluster. For more information, see
Gluster 3.2: Configuring Distributed Replicated Volumes[ Configuring
Distributed Replicated Volumes].
* Distributed Striped - Stripes files across multiple nodes in the
cluster. For more information, see
Gluster 3.2: Configuring Distributed Striped Volumes[ Configuring
Distributed Striped Volumes].

*Note:* Gluster recommends you to set rpc-auth-allow-insecure option to
ON if there are too many bricks in each volume or if there are too many
services which have already utilized all the privileged ports in the
system. Turning this option ON allows ports to accept/reject messages
from insecure ports. So, use this option only if your deployment
requires it. For more information on setting this option, see
Gluster 3.2: Setting Volume Options[ Setting Volume Options].

Make sure you start your volumes before you try to mount them or else
client operations after the mount will hang, see
Gluster 3.2:_Starting Volumes[ Starting Volumes] for details.
