We recommend you to use Samba for exporting Gluster volumes through the
CIFS protocol.

*To export volumes through CIFS protocol*

1.  Mount a Gluster volume. For more information on mounting volumes,
see Gluster 3.2: Mounting Volumes[ Mounting Volumes] +
2.  Setup Samba configuration to export the mount point of the Gluster
volume. +
 +
For example, if a Gluster volume is mounted on /mnt/gluster, you must
edit smb.conf file to enable exporting this through CIFS. Open smb.conf
file in an editor and add the following lines for a simple
configuration: +
 +
  [glustertest] +
             comment = For testing a Gluster volume exported through
CIFS +
             path = /mnt/gluster +
             read only = no +
             guest ok = yes +
 +

Save the changes and start the smb service using your systems init
scripts. Now the Gluster volume can be mounted using the CIFS
protocol. +
 +
*Note:* You must repeat these steps on each Gluster node. For more
advanced configurations, see Samba documentation.
