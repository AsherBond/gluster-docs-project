Gluster Geo-replication provides a continuous, asynchronous, and
incremental replication service from from site to another over Local
Area Networks (LANs), Wide Area Network (WANs), and across the Internet.

Using Gluster Geo-replication, you can establish data redundancy in your
storage environment, providing disaster recovery through existing LAN,
WAN, and Internet connections.

Gluster Geo-replication uses a master–slave model, whereby replication
and mirroring occurs between the following partners:

* Master – A Gluster volume
* Slave – A backup Gluster volume or a simple non-gluster
mountpoint(Gluster is not required to be running on slave nodes)

This section introduces Gluster Geo-replication, illustrates the various
deployment scenarios, and explains how to configure the system to
provide replication and mirroring in your environment.
