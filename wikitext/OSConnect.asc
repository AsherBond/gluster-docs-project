Gluster Storage Connector for OpenStack Resource Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are pleased to announce the Gluster storage connector for the
community. This will bring the following capabilities for OpenStack
users:

* Live migration of VM's without service outage
* Live resume of VM's, even on different hypervisors
* Global scale-out filesystem for VM's

Right now you can get all of this with GlusterFS, if you're willing to
get your hands dirty and follow the manual process of installing
GlusterFS.

Later, we will release scripts for automating the process.
