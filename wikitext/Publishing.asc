Commits done are initially only local. These commits have to be pushed
to the central repository. This has to go through a strict review
process within the team before being signed off to the glusterfs
repository. Git has support which enables us to implement a convenient
email based review/sign-off policy. The format-patch command gives an
SMTP header which can be used by mail clients like mutt or mail to
submit the changes in your commit as a patch.

`sh$ ./format-patch.sh -M -1`

This command generates a 0001-summary.patch file for the last one commit
which is suitable for emailing. Patch files for multiple commits can be
generated by using a higher -N number (like -2).

The generated patch file should be submitted for review by mailing it to
gluster-devel@nongnu.org.

`sh$ mutt -H 0001-summary.patch gluster-devel@nongnu.org`

The above command creates a mail template filled with Subject and Body
ready to be sent. There is a region between the mail header and the diff
content where notes can be added. This region should mention the
mandatory reviewer. All developers are however encouraged to review any
submitted patch.
