original product much easier.http://www.mbtbequemeschuhe.com/ ,

Similar to designer clothing, handbags are all about the details. A card
that declares the item authenticity is no longer the main standard. Most
high-end handbags come with booklets of information that describe the
product as well as the process of what makes it an original. History
about the designer can help you spot an original as well.

Nearly all Hermes bags on the open (resale) market are counterfeit.
Below is a ot list?of traits to look for when shopping for your
authentic Hermes purse.

?Authentic Hermes bags have the Hermes emblem engraved rather than
embossed on the hardware. Engraving is a process where the letters sit
lower than the metal, and embossing is the opposite, meaning that the
letters are raised.

?Hermes handles are equal in size and length. There are no variations,
and this small detail can often be the deal breaker.

?Standing by itself on a stable base is a trademark characteristic of
all Hermes bags. The hardware that allows the bag to do this is not
detachable.

?A high-end handbag will have uniform stitching that is consistent
throughout the bag. The stitching is the same color and is always even.
Hermes stitching is diagonal and not horizontal.

?Leather comes in a variety of grades, and Hermes is known for only
using the best. Nearly 98% of all leather they purchase is rejected.
They use the top 2% to create their handbags and it is the highest grade
imaginable. Leather can be flawless, although erfect?leather is never
completely uniform, stiff, or shiny.

?The label is the designer signature finishing touch, and is therefore
very important. An original product will not contain spelling errors
anywhere. Any type of misspelling should raise immediate red flags about
the quality of your Hermes handbag. Fake labels are cheaply made,
resulting in a cheap appearance. Their stitching isn't uniform, often
varying in color, and the labeling is often inconsistent. Counterfeits
will often pluralize a name as well. For instance, Burberrys of London
versus the real Burberry of London. These little details are vitally
important in determining the quality and worth of a Hermes purse.

?Hermes uses a unique dating system that allows them to date each purse
they create. This little stamp can be found on the underside of the
straps on each purse.

?Packaging is very important as well. What your purse comes inhether it
tissue paper, bags, or boxeshould match the level of quality of purse
you are purchasing. A purse that costs several thousands of dollars does
not come wrapped in butcher paper. Boxes that are too big or too small
are giveaways that you may be dealing with a fake. Luxury handbags often
come in dust bags that are not flimsy or cheaply made. Hermes dust bags
are made of strong, soft, orange cotton flannel. Older Hermes handbags
may come in a tan velour bag with a somewhat differing pattern. Since
Birkins are fairly new (1984), they all come in orange dust bags, and
there is no such thing as a vintage Birkin.

?Hardware is important to Hermes as well. Much of their hardware is made
from gold and palladium, and it is protected by its own special coating.
Every item sold in a Hermes retail store comes with this protective
covering, and it is never removed until after purchase.

With a little consideration and some research, you can save yourself the
grief, time, and money you incur by purchasing a low-quality purse.
Recognizing original, authentic products requires an eye for excellence.
Cultivate this, and your transaction will be just as authentic as your
Hermes purse.
