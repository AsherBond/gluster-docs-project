The Gluster Native Client is a POSIX conformant, FUSE-based client
running in user space. Gluster Native Client is the recommended method
for accessing volumes when high concurrency and high write performance
is required. When reading many small files, the native NFS client will
perform better.

This guide introduces the Gluster Native Client and explains how to
install the software on client machines. This guide also describes how
to mount volumes on clients (both manually and automatically) and how to
test to verify that the volume has mounted successfully.
