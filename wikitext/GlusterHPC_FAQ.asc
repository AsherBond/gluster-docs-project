What is Gluster?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gluster is a GNU cluster distribution aimed at commoditizing
Supercomputing and Superstorage. Core of the Gluster provides a platform
for developing clustering applications tailored for a specific tasks
such as HPC Clustering, Storage Clustering, Enterprise Provisioning,
Database Clustering etc. Gluster is designed for massive scalability and
performance from ground up. Makes heavy use of muti-casting and RDMA
where ever possible.

[[]]
Minimum system requirements to use Gluster?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use Gluster, you will need

* A cluster of ia32 or x86-64 systems with atleast 512MB RAM (1GB
recommended) each.
* A supported GNU/Linux distribution pre-installed (for GlusterHPC) on
the master node.

How do I install for GlusterHPC on the master node
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[]]
Does the client hard drives need to be pre-partitioned to match the
master-node?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[]]
Do all the nodes need to be the same equipment or can I use "Just a
Bunch of Computers"?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[]]
Does Gluster support my distribution?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently Gluster has been tested on

* Debian
* Slackware
* Redhat Enterprise (and clones such as ScientificLinux and CentOS)
* Fedora Core (1-4)
* Ubuntu
* Gentoo
* SLES (Suse Linux Enterprise Server) 10
* OpenSUSE

NOTE:

The following are known issues and are being worked on:

* Distributions should be installed without LVM/Software Raid. Support
for LVM/SW Raid is being added currently.
* Fedora Core 5 with SELinux turned on fails to root login on client
nodes.

[[]]
Why is Gluster a non-GNU project?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

non-GNU means `not yet GNU'. For a project to be certified as a GNU
project, it has to be submitted to the GNU evaluation team, which on
approval will be dubbed an official GNU project. Gluster will soon be
submitted for GNU approval. For more information on this topic, read
from here http://www.gnu.org/help/evaluation.html

[[]]
Bulde meaning?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

'bulde' is a slang word used for word 'burude' (from kannada language) ,
which means brain/head in English.

'bulde' is also nick name of one of the gluster developer @ #gluster (on
irc.gnu.org).

How can I contribute?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Contribution can come in may forms. Word of mouth marketing, documenting
and writing articles, bug reports, patches.. If you are developer, you
can start with *link:Gluster Hacking Guide[Gluster Hacking Guide]*.

[[]]
How portable is Gluster?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ideally, Gluster is portable to any architecture which has a GNU
toolchain and a bootloader which can be built with the GNU toolchain for
that architecture.

Gluster currently works only on the GNU/Linux operating system.

Gluster should work on any GNU/Linux distribution, which is file system
standards compliant.

GlusterHPC FAQ
--------------

[[]]
How is GlusterHPC better than ROCKS or OSCAR?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GlusterHPC is an application of Gluster for High Performance Computing.
It packages a rich set of clustering software stack (see
link:GlusterHPC Applications[GlusterHPC Applications]).

GlusterHPC is

* Designed for massive scalability (16 nodes or 65,000 nodes makes no
difference). Much of the building blocks of Gluster are already powering
worlds top supercomputers.
* Portability (across distributions and architectures).
* Modular and extensible.
* Built on Gluster Platform which extends clustering technology beyond
HPC to database, storage, enterprise provisioning, etc.
* Very easy to use with a clean dialog based front-end.
* Backed by supercomputing experts.
* Supports multi-casting and Infiniband.
* Centralized remote screen control.
* Very easy to add new features or customize.
* Doesn't require a database server to store configuration information.

[[]]
My _/etc/hosts_ file got overwritten by GlusterHPC. There was no back
up. What to do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now, GlusterHPC supports backing up the original file (v1.0-rc3 onwards)
. _/etc/hosts_ file in the Image will be stored as
_/etc/hosts.orig-gluster_ and now the new entries are appended to the
original file.

Similarly, network config files, /root/.ssh dir will be backed up as
.orig-gluster

GlusterEP FAQ
-------------

[[]]
How is GlusterEP better than SystemImager or RedHat Kickstart?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both SystemImager and Kickstart are very hard to setup and manage.
Gluster is better because

* Supports highest number of distributions - Debian, Slackware, Redhat
and clones such as ScientificLinux (CentOS), Fedora Core (1-4), and
Ubuntu.
* Automated image capture: Just remote boot your system and select
capture image option.
* Server administration console: User and image management
(view/add/delete)
* Multi-user support: Each user can organize his/her own set of images.
* Secure: Images are password protected and transfers are encrypted.
* Easier to setup: Just boot the server and answer few questions.
* Multiple NIC support.
* Backup: Can be used as server/workstation network backup software for
entire OS.
* Dual-boot images are supported.
* Extensive hardware compatibility.
* Images are compressed for efficient storage.

[[]]
My system does not support PXE. Can I use GlusterEP?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gluster provides two alternatives for situations where the BIOS does not
support PXE boot.

* client boot disk - You can create a client boot disk on a USB stick or
in the form of a bootable ISO (which can be burnt to an empty
CD-ROM/RW).

* pxe boot disk - You can create a PXE boot floppy/USB/ISO which will
boot your system as though it supported PXE from the BIOS itself.

NOTE: client boot disk is the only option when GlusterEP client is
outside the master node's network and hence cannot perform PXE boot even
with a pxe boot disk.

Developers FAQ
--------------

[[]]
How can I contact the developers?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The developers can be reached on the mailing list
gluster-devel@nongnu.org. Visit http://www.gluster.org/mailing-list.php
for subscription.

You can also reach the developers on IRC at irc.gnu.org (freenode) in
the #gluster channel. Visit http://www.gluster.org/core-team.php for
nicknames.

[[]]
Why Gluster has its own tool chain?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most of Gluster works in LIVE mode and Gluster is distro independent. So
everything is built from source. To ensure sanity of the build involving
everything, right from the kernel to the shell. Having our own toolchain
makes the overall system predictable like compatible compiler version
and libc version, specific compiler features and language support and
makes Gluster build-system independent (and hence, distro independent)

It also makes easier to port Gluster to new architecture, only a matter
of ensuring that Gluster compiles in the new toolchain used.

[[]]
How to build a new tool chain?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gluster toolchains are built using crosstool. Crosstool is available
here http://kegel.com/crosstool/crosstool-0.42.tar.gz . Steps for
building toolchain for gluster involve:

* Extract crosstool
* Edit options file, -static.dat (i686-static.dat for i686 arch) and
change TARGET to 'i686-gluster-linux-gnu', make sure that USE_SYSROOT=1.
* Edit demo-.sh file and set the RESULT_TOP, TARBALLS_DIR to relavent
paths.
* Edit demo-.sh and set GCC_LANGUAGES to "c, c++, fortran".
* Edit demo-.sh and uncomment the line relevent to newest gcc and glibc.

`  Eg. uncomment the line with following command in it, to build gcc-4.1.0 and glibc-2.3.6.` +
`         eval \`cat i686-static.dat gcc-4.1.0-glibc-2.3.6.dat\` sh all.sh --notest`

* Now run run the demo-.sh script to build the toolchain.

I am interested in porting Gluster to XXX arch, Where do I start?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gluster is designed to be portable from scratch. Except boot-loader,
entire Gluster is built from source using Gluster's own tool chain. Your
first step would be to build a tool chain for your platform and adding
your boot loader binary to the repository. Rest is mostly compilation
work. Look for more information in *link:Gluster Hacking Guide[Gluster
Hacking Guide]*.
