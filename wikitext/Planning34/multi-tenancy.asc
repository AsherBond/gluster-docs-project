Multi-tenancy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Possibilities for 3.4:

* introduce concept of "tenant"

OR

* make relationship between ___ and processes more fungible
** questions: what about admin ops; rebalance and repair
** cloudfs approach: single volume w/ multiple inode tables underneath

* mapping 1 volume per tenant:
** scalability is problematic
** gluster volumes not scalable

the HekaFS way
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Concept of virtual volumes:

* solve from management layer
** can rebalance all virtual volumes from admin layer
** make rebalance take a set of volumes

OpenShift Way
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fully containerized - gears run multi-tenantly. Each node can have
several gears, and users want to be able to create shared storage
services for all of their gears.

* Each gear opens its own connection
** then from server side can we do reverse?
