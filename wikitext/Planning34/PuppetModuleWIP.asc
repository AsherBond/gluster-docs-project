Feature
~~~~~~~

Puppet module for easy turnkey deployment of gluster and de-facto
documentation on various gluster topologies.

[[]]
Summary
~~~~~~~

Puppet is a commonly used tool in the devops/sysadmin community to
deploy and manage servers and software. Offering a puppet module for
gluster is a great opportunity to lower the bar for new users who want
to try out gluster, it is a time saver for users who want to deploy a
large gluster installation, and it is good documentation for an
interested user who is trying to understand the architecture of a
gluster deployment.

[[]]
Owners
~~~~~~

"Owners" seems like a strange heading as the code is Free Software.

Dan Bode has contributed some great advice - Thanks Dan! Johnmark has
been facilitating this project. Thanks for the encouragement Johnmark.

Current status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An initial release is available. More improvements are coming. This
module could benefit from a gluster developers recommendations on ideal
gluster runtime parameters and performance tweaking. Code is available
here:
https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-gluster[https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-gluster]

[[]]
Detailed description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This puppet module provides a more complete and automatic management of
gluster. For the sysadmins/devops who prefer a less complex, simpler
approach, fewer of the puppet classes can be used.

[[]]
Benefit to GlusterFS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A puppet module will help customers to deploy their solution faster, and
with recommended defaults.

[[]]
Scope
~~~~~

\1. Nature of proposed change External puppet module. Doesn't impact
main gluster development.

\2. Implications on manageability None

\3. Implications on presentation layer None

\4. Implications on persistence layer None

\5. Implications on GlusterFS backend None

\6. Modification to GlusterFS metadata No

\7. Implications on 'glusterd' No

[[]]
Testing
~~~~~~~

Deploy gluster using puppet. Different topologies could be offered in
examples/ directory.

[[]]
User Experience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simply choose the server names, volume names, IP addresses and topology
for your cluster. Puppet takes care of the rest.

[[]]
Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Puppet!

[[]]
Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not much is required. The examples/ directory is the primary go to
place. Sysadmins/devops commonly use the puppet code itself as de-facto
documentation.

[[]]
Status
~~~~~~

An initial prototype is available! The code is Free Software, so feel
free to have a look. The code base could benefit from some specific
gluster developer recommendations to optimize and tweak the built in
volume key/value parameters.

Other modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are at least two other puppet modules available. Google mentions:
https://github.com/evolvingweb/puppet-glusterfs[1], and semiosis (on
gluster irc) is the author of:
https://github.com/semiosis/puppet-gluster[2]. Different users will have
different module preferences. These two modules tend to take a more
"hands off" approach and automate much less, whereas the module by James
Shubin https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-glusterfs[3] can automate
much more, however some sysadmins might prefer to do certain parts
manually. Disclaimer, I wrote this, and this is my opinion, so please
make your own evaluations :)

Comments and discussion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A lot of users have shown interest in this. A puppet module is a
valuable addition to any software project where deployment isn't
trivial.
