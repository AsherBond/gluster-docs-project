Gluster 3.2: Installing the Gluster Virtual Storage Appliance for VMware[
Installing the Gluster Virtual Storage Appliance for VMware>>]

Before installing Gluster Virtual Storage Appliance for VMware, verify
that your environment matches the minimum requirements:

*General*

Verify the following:

* DNS is properly configured for your environment
* Centralized time servers are available (required in clustered
environments)

*Virtual Machines*

Verify the following:

* The virtual machine is running HW v7
* The virtual machine uses the default configuration settings, as
supplied by Gluster (except as noted in this topic)
* Guests are not set to "sync time with host"
* The VMware Tools version of the appliance matches the ESX host (VMware
Tools needs to be loaded in the guest by default)
* The VMware Tools version of the appliance matches the ESX host (the
appliance comes pre-installed with VMware tools for ESX 4.1)

*Note:* Running non-Gluster virtual machines on the same host or
datastore as the Gluster Virtual Storage Appliance may affect Gluster
performance if resources are not properly allocated.

*When Using ESX Hosts Managed by VirtualCenter*

Verify the following:

* VMware HCL hardware (Virtual Machine Hardware v7.0) is used, running
ESX 4.1
* ESX hosts are clustered, and any Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS)
rules are defined against these clusters
* Remote storage allows vMotion/DRS of the appliances

*Note:* You cannot use an SQLExpress database with Gluster Virtual
Storage Appliance.

*When Using Standalone ESX Hosts*

Verify the following:

* All hardware is on the VMware
http://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/search.php[HCL] (Hardware
Compatibility List)
* 2GB RAM is configured for each virtual machine, plus 800MB for Service
Console or COS (up to 8GB or more is recommended for each virtual
machine)
* 2 vCPUs and VMXNET3 network device is recommended
* ESX hosts are capable of running 64-bit machines, and the ESX host
operating system is set to 800MB (RAM)

::
  *Note:* Nehalem procs in the ESX server is recommended to take
  advantage of appliance performance tuning.
