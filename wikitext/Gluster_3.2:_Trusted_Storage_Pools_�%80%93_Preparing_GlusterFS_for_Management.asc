Gluster 3.2: Adding Servers to Trusted Storage Pool[ Adding Servers to
Trusted Storage Pool>>]

A storage pool is a trusted network of storage servers. When you start
the first server, the storage pool consists of that server alone. To add
additional storage servers to the storage pool, you can use the probe
command from a storage server that is already trusted.

*Note:* The GlusterFS service must be running on all storage servers
that you want to add to the storage pool. See
Gluster 3.2: Starting the glusterd Daemon[ Starting the GlusterFS
Service] for more information. +
