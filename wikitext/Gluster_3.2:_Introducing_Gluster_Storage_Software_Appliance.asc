The Gluster Storage Software Appliance is an ISO image which installs on
bare metal (that is, a non-virtualized physical machine). The Storage
Software Appliance integrates GlusterFS with CentOS for deployment on
any Red Hat Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) certified server and
storage hardware.

The Storage Software Appliance enables enterprises to treat physical
storage as a virtualized, scalable, standardized, scale-on- demand, and
centrally managed pool of storage. Enterprises now have the capability
to leverage storage resources the same way they have leveraged computing
resources, radically improving storage economics in the process via the
use of commodity storage hardware. The Storage Software Appliance global
namespace capability aggregates disk and memory resources into a unified
storage volume that is abstracted from the physical hardware. The
Storage Software Appliance supports multi-tenancy by partitioning users
or groups into logical volumes on shared storage.

The Storage Software Appliance installs in userspace and scales to
petabytes of storage capacity. Storage Software Appliance is
POSIX-compliant, so the interface abstracts vendor APIs and applications
need not be modified.

By scaling performance and capacity linearly, capacity is able to be
added as required in only a few minutes across a wide variety of
workloads without affecting performance. Storage can also be centrally
managed across a wide variety of workloads enabling operations to more
efficiently manage storage used for a variety of purposes.

Storage Software Appliances enable users to eliminate their dependence
on costly, difficult to deploy and manage monolithic storage arrays.
With a Storage Software Appliance enterprises can now deploy commodity
storage hardware and realize superior economics.

The heart of Gluster Storage Software Appliance is GlusterFS; an open
source distributed filesystem distinguished by multiple architectural
differences, including a modular, stackable design and a unique,
no-metadata server architecture. Eliminating the metadata server
provides better performance, improved linear scalability, and increased
reliability. As the primary authors and sole sponsors of the Gluster
project, Gluster is committed to supporting both its commercial
customers and a thriving 2000+ developer community.
