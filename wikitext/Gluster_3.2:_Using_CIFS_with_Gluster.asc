Gluster 3.2: Using CIFS to Mount Volumes[ Using CIFS to Mount Volumes>>]

You can export glusterfs mount point as the samba export, and then mount
it using CIFS protocol.

This guide describes how to mount CIFS shares on Microsoft Windows-based
clients (both manually and automatically) and how to test to verify that
the volume has mounted successfully.

*Note:* CIFS access using the Mac OS X Finder is not supported, however,
you can use the Mac OS X command line to access Gluster volumes using
CIFS.
