About Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

http://www.ovirt.org[Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization] is a free Red
Hat / Fedora specific virtualization management system that allows you
to manage virtual machines through a web interface using libvirt. The
libvirt library allows Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization to manage
virtual machines hosted on KVM virtual machine servers. oVirt is an open
source software with backing from Red Hat.

Compute and Storage Virtualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Traditional NFS and iSCSI solutions create I/O bottlenecks as your
virtual machine environment scales. The storage box is also often a
single point of failure. Managing multiple NAS volumes and iSCSI LUNs
leads to excessive management costs. GlusterFS adds virtualized storage
capability to oVirt. Individual storage servers can be consolidated in a
virtual storage pool with a global namespace. GlusterFS takes care of
complete storage management, including replication, high availability,
and volume management.

Red Hat libvirt natively mounts the GlusterFS VM image volume (storage
pool) to launch virtual machines. Multiple VM images can be hosted on a
single global volume unless administrator prefers to group them under
different volume names. Applications access GlusterFS volumes through
native GlusterFS, NFS, CIFS, FTP, and WebDAV.

Configuring oVirt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GlusterFS client is integrated into Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization.

If you are already familiar with the oVirt install instructions, the
specific step required for GlusterFS is to select it as the storage pool
type.

If you are unfamiliar with configuring oVirt, follow this procedure:

1.  On Storage Setup, click on *Add Storage* to create a new storage
pool.

Add the storage pool by mapping GlusterFS export as a storage pool named
*vmimages*. The IP address is the address of the first node from the
GlusterFS storage cluster. Export is the volume exported from the
storage cluster.

Create an oVirt volume named *Fedora-10*.

The oVirt Storage tab now lists the created pool/volume:

Add a virtual machine to *Fedora-10* volume on *vmimages* storage pool.
