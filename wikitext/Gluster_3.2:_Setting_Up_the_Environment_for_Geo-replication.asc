*Time Synchronization*

* On bricks of a geo-replication master volume, all the servers' time
must be uniform. You are recommended to set up NTP service to keep the
bricks sync in time and avoid out-of-time sync effect. +
 +
 For example: In a Replicated volume where brick1 of the master is at
12.20 hrs and brick 2 of the master is at 12.10 hrs with 10 minutes time
lag, all the changes in brick2 between this period may go unnoticed
during synchronization of files with Slave.

*To setup Gluster Geo-replication for SSH*

Password-less login has to be set up between the host machine (where
geo-replication Start command will be issued) and the remote machine
(where slave process should be launched through SSH).

1.  On the node where geo-replication sessions are to be set up, run the
following command: +
 # ssh-keygen -f /etc/glusterd/geo-replication/secret.pem +
Press Enter twice to avoid passphrase.
2.  On an SSH slave where you want to use the account georep-user for
geo-replication slave purposes, add the content of
/etc/glusterd/geo-replication/secret.pem.pub to
~georep-user/.ssh/authorized_keys file. +
 *Note:* Create ~georep-user/.ssh/authorized_keys file if it does not
exist, so that only georep-user has permission to access the .ssh
directory and its subdirectories. +
 As of now, georep-user must be a superuser or an alias of it, but this
restriction will be removed in future release.
3.  Repeat the above steps on all the slaves.
