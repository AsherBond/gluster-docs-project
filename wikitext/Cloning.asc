Git being truly distributed, does not differentiate between a repository
and a working copy. Unlike in TLA and other version control systems
where you 'checkout' a working copy from a 'repository', in Git you
clone a repository to your local machine. There is no difference between
the original repository and the cloned repository and they are
symmetrical. It is up to the usage convention to bring about the effect
of a master repository and a local repository (cloned local copy).

The repository can be cloned using:

`sh$ git clone https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs.git`

This will create glusterfs under the current working directory which
will be your 'working copy' for all practical purposes. When the master
repository is progressing with changes from other developers, your local
repository should be kept up-to-date by frequently 'pull'ing commits.

`sh$ git pull`

Note: This is equivalent to 'tla update' for our model.

For getting release branches (which are more stable than the default
'master' branch), follow the below procedures:

`sh$ cd glusterfs` +
`sh$ git branch` +
`* master` +
`sh$ git checkout -b v3.1.3 origin/v3.1.3` +
`sh$ git branch` +
`  master` +
`* v3.1.3` +
`sh$ git pull`
