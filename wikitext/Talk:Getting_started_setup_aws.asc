Problem: Need persistent hostnames for glusterfs servers/bricks although
in EC2 local-ipv4 and local-hostname of an instance can change.

Solution Principle: EC2 provides split-horizon DNS so that inside EC2
the public-hostname resolves to the *current* local-ipv4 address while
outside EC2 the public-hostname resolves to the public-ipv4 (which is
random when *not* using Elastic IPs, and is consistent when *using*
elastic IPs.) I will now apply this principle in two practical
solutions.

Solution 1: Your own FQDNs using CNAMEs to map to EC2 public-hostnames.
(I recommend this solution)

This does *not require* the use of Elastic IP addresses, but it is
*compatible* with them.

Set up a zone for your cloud instances, perhaps cloud.yourdomain.net.
Create CNAME records for your glusterfs servers, say
gluster1.cloud.yourdomain.net - glusterN.cloud.yourdomain.net. Point
those CNAME records at the EC2 public-hostnames of your gluster server
instances.

EC2 instances, without the use of elastic IP addresses, get a randomly
assigned public-hostname. Whenever this changes (say after a stop/start,
or after replacing an instance with a new one) you will need to update
the CNAME for that server to point to the new public-hostname of that
server.

When using Elastic IP addresses, the CNAME will not need to change
because the public-hostname of the elastic IP is permenant -- however,
you will need to re-attach the elastic IP to the instance. Attaching an
elastic IP address causes a brief interruption of service, so I
recommend against using them in cases like this where they are not
absolutely necessary.

Solution 2: Elastic IP addresses

If you do not want to set up your own DNS zone and manage CNAME records,
then you can use Elastic IPs -- although they have their own
administrative overhead to deal with. Be sure to use the public-hostname
of the elastic ip address for your gluster server/brick addresses. This
will never change as long as you own the elastic IP address. EC2
provides split-horizon DNS so that inside EC2 the public-hostname
resolves to the *current* local-ipv4 address while outside EC2 the
public-hostname resolves to the *permenant* public-ipv4 address of the
elastic IP.

Final Note:

People often find it necessary to alias each machine's own FQDN to
127.0.0.1 in their respective /etc/hosts files.
