This howto assumes you know how to find your appropriate repo and
install packages.

Install glusterfs-server and (for rpm based distros)
glusterfs-geo-replication.

For this demo, _server1_ will be the *master* and _server2_ will be the
*slave*. _server1_ has a volume already created and started named
_myvol_.

Start glusterd on the slave (it's assumed that it's already started and
running on the master): server2# chkconfig glusterd on server2# service
glusterd start

Probe the slave to add it to the trusted pool (if the master hasn't been
probed by another member of the trusted pool, probe it from the slave as
well):

`server1# gluster peer probe server2`

Create the target directory on the *slave*: server2# mkdir -p
/data/myvol_slave

Create a ssh key and install it on the slave (leave the passphrase
blank): server1# ssh-keygen -f
/var/lib/glusterd/geo-replication/secret.pem Generating public/private
rsa key pair. Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): Enter same
passphrase again: Your identification has been saved in
/var/lib/glusterd/geo-replication/secret.pem. Your public key has been
saved in /var/lib/glusterd/geo-replication/secret.pem.pub. The key

Start geo-replication: server1# gluster volume geo-replication myvol
server2:/data/myvol_slave start Starting geo-replication session between
myvol & server2:/data/myvol_slave has been successful

Wait a short time and check the status: server1# gluster volume
geo-replication myvol server2:/data/myvol_slave status MASTER SLAVE
STATUS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
myvol server2:/data/myvol_slave OK

If you no longer want this geo-replication: server1# gluster volume
geo-replication myvol server2:/data/myvol_slave stop Stopping
geo-replication session between myvol & server2:/data/myvol_slave has
been successful
