A petabyte (derived from the SI prefix peta- ) is a unit of information
equal to one quadrillion (short scale) bytes, or 1000 terabytes. The
unit symbol for the petabyte is PB. The prefix peta- (P) indicates a
power of 1000:

1 PB = 1,000,000,000,000,000 B = 10005 B = 1015 B.

The term "pebibyte" (PiB), using a binary prefix, is used for the
corresponding power of 1024.
