Open source describes practices in production and development that
promote access to the end product's source materials. Some consider open
source a philosophy, others consider it a pragmatic methodology.

Before the term open source became widely adopted, developers and
producers used a variety of phrases to describe the concept; open source
gained hold with the rise of the Internet, and the attendant need for
massive retooling of the computing source code.

Opening the source code enabled a self-enhancing diversity of production
models, communication paths, and interactive communities. Subsequently,
a new, three-word phrase "open source software" was born to describe the
environment that the new copyright, licensing, domain, and consumer
issues created.
