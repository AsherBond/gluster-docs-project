Gluster 3.2: Setting Access ACLs[ Setting Access ACLs>>]

You can set two types of POSIX ACLs, that is, access ACLs and default
ACLs. You can use access ACLs to grant permission for a specific file or
directory. You can use default ACLs only on a directory but if a file
inside that directory does not have an ACLs, it inherits the permissions
of the default ACLs of the directory.
