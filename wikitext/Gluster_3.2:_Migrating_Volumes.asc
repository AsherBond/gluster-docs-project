Gluster 3.2: Rebalancing Volumes[ Rebalancing Volumes>>]

You can migrate the data from one brick to another, as needed, while the
cluster is online and available.

*To migrate a volume*

1.  Make sure the new brick, server5 in this example, is successfully
added to the cluster. +
 +
For more information, see
Gluster 3.2: Adding Servers to Trusted Storage Pool[ Adding Servers to
Trusted Storage Pool]. +
 +
2.  Migrate the data from one brick to another using the following
command: +
 +
# gluster volume replace-brick _VOLNAME_ _BRICK_ _NEW-BRICK_ start +
 +
For example, to migrate the data in server3:/exp3 to server5:/exp5 in
test-volume: +
 +
# gluster volume replace-brick test-volume server3:/exp3 server5:/exp5
start +
Replace brick start operation successful +
 +
*Note:* You need to have the FUSE package installed on the server on
which you are running the replace-brick command for the command to
work. +
 +
3.  To pause the migration operation, if needed, use the following
command: +
 +
# gluster volume replace-brick _VOLNAME_ _BRICK_ _NEW-BRICK_ pause +
 +
For example, to pause the data migration from server3:/exp3 to
server5:/exp5 in test-volume: +
 +
# gluster volume replace-brick test-volume server3:/exp3 server5:exp5
pause +
Replace brick pause operation successful +
 +
4.  To abort the migration operation, if needed, use the following
command: +
 +
# gluster volume replace-brick _VOLNAME_ _BRICK_ _NEW-BRICK_ abort +
 +
For example, to abort the data migration from server3:/exp3 to
server5:/exp5 in test-volume: +
 +
# gluster volume replace-brick test-volume server3:/exp3 server5:exp5
abort +
Replace brick abort operation successful +
 +
5.  Check the status of the migration operation using the following
command: +
 +
# gluster volume replace-brick _VOLNAME_ _BRICK_ _NEW-BRICK_ status +
 +
For example, to check the data migration status from server3:/exp3 to
server5:/exp5 in test-volume: +
 +
# gluster volume replace-brick test-volume server3:/exp3 server5:/exp5
status +
Current File = /usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.31-14/block/Makefile Number of
files migrated = 10567 +
Migration complete +
 +
The status command shows the current file being migrated along with the
current total number of files migrated. After completion of migration,
it displays Migration complete. +
 +
6.  Commit the migration of data from one brick to another using the
following command: +
 +
# gluster volume replace-brick _VOLNAME_ _BRICK_ _NEW-BRICK_ commit +
 +
For example, to commit the data migration from server3:/exp3 to
server5:/exp5 in test-volume: +
 +
# gluster volume replace-brick test-volume server3:/exp3 server5:/exp5
commit +
replace-brick commit successful +
 +
The commit command completes the migration of data to the new brick. +
 +

Verify the migration of brick by viewing the volume info using the
following command: +
 +
# gluster volume info _VOLNAME_ +
 +
For example, to check the volume information of new brick server5:/exp5
in test-volume: +
 +
# gluster volume info test-volume +
Volume Name: testvolume +
 Type: Replicate +
Status: Started +
Number of Bricks: 4 +
Transport-type: tcp +
Bricks: +
Brick1: server5:/exp1 +
Brick2: server5:/exp2 +
Brick3: server5:/exp4 +
Brick4: server5:/exp5 +
 The new volume details are displayed.

In the above example, previously, there were bricks; 1,2,3, and 4 and
now brick 3 is replaced by brick 5.
