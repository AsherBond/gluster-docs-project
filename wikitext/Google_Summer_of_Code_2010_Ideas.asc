Gluster is applying for participation in Google Summer of Code 2010
program. We are excited to participate for the first time. Here is a
list of our ideas ...

[[]]
Gluster Storage Platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[]]
Automated test suite for UI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Develop automated test framework for Gluster Storage Platform UI
testing. Tests should include functionality, accessibility, security and
browser compatibility.

*Prerequisites:* Good understanding of web application testing is ad
added advantage. Web application programming knowledge essential.

[[]]
Gluster File System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[]]
/proc-like interface to GlusterFS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This project involves exposing the internal data structures of GlusterFS
through a /proc-like interface. Some of the things that can be
accomplished using such an interface are:

* Expose other views of the filesystem. For example, each of the
backends of a replicate pair can be individually shown, or the backends
that are part of a single namespace can be exposed.
* Expose all currently open files and the per-xlator state associated
with them.
* Expose the entire inode table and the per-xlator state associated with
them.
* Support dynamically changing translator parameters (think "echo 3 >
/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches").
* Expose latency and other statistical data about file operations. This
would allow profiling tools to easily parse and graph this data.

This is an open-ended project, and the more ideas the better.

*Pre-requisites*: Good C skills, and a good imagination.

[[]]
Wireshark plugin for the GlusterFS protocol
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Wireshark is a popular open-source protocol analyzer
(http://www.wireshark.org/). It would be nice to have a plugin that
allows Wireshark to interpret the GlusterFS binary protocol. There are
already many plugins available which analyze protocols such as CIFS,
NFS, etc. A GlusterFS plugin would be very useful in debugging
performance issues and other problems.

*Pre-requisites*: Good C programming experience. Familiarity with
Wireshark will be an advantage.

[[]]
Implement ACL support for GlusterFS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Access Control Lists (ACL) are a powerful mechanism for fine-grained
access control for file systems. This project aims at bringing in
support for ACLs into GlusterFS while maintaining compatibility or at
least extensibility for supporting CIFS, Posix and NFSv4 style ACLs. The
candidate will be required to investigate these existing ACL models,
design and implement the selected ACL model for GlusterFS.

This project will expose candidates to access control and security
mechanisms not just for disk-based file systems but also on a clustered
file system including exposure to global standards like CIFS and NFSv4.

*Prerequisites:* Good C programming experience. Familiarity with ACL on
shared filesystems will be an advantage

[[]]
Reed Solomon algorithm based M:N redundancy translator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This features adds redundancy ability to GlusterFS such that M nodes
worth data is stored across N nodes, where N > M, and N-M nodes worth of
data is "redundancy" data such that, any of the N-M nodes can fail at a
given time.

*Prerequisites:* Good C programming experience.

[[]]
Compression translator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This feature stores data on GlusterFS in a compressed manner and
uncompresses on the fly to present data as "normal" files and folders.
Different data compression algorithms should be selectable as
configuration options.

*Prerequisites:* Good C programming experience. Familiarity with various
compression algorithms is desired.

[[]]
Encryption translator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Encryption is a critical component of privacy protection measures. This
project aims at bringing in encryption support for GlusterFS file
system's read-write path. The candidate will have to investigate various
cryptographic algorithms and implement or evaluate any existing
implementations in order to select the most suitable ones for a
clustered file system. Encryption support will be incorporated in a way
that allows storage admins to select the privacy levels and protection
strength through configurable options and algorithms. Implementation
must include key management as well for integration with network- or
organization-wide identity management.

*Prerequisites:* Good C programming experience. Familiarity with
encryption algorithms and key management is an added advantage.

[[]]
Monitoring Tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Explore a framework to monitor system calls, throughput, availability,
diskspace, concurrent clients, server load, CPU/Memory usage etc for
GlusterFS. Plugins for various open source monitoring tools such as
Nagios, Zenoss, Groundwork Opensource, Munin is essential.

*Prerequisites:* Good programming skills is essential.
Network/Administration experience is an advantage.

[[]]
System Statistics and Performance Framework
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Review GlusterFS code and determine performance bottlenecks by
implementing probes (similar to SystemTap or Dprobes). A complete
analysis of necessary parameters such as latencies, throughput to
improve performance with minimum overhead is essential.

*Prerequisites:* Good C programming skills.

[[]]
Migration Toolkit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Develop a set of tools, methodology where migration of data, users, and
configuration (like replication) can be performed from Lustre, Hadoop
etc to Gluster without compromising on functionality. since it is not
always possible to have a complete second set of hardware available all
the time, and also not possible to bring the storage down for extended
period of time, the methodology should address phased migration.
Possible co-existence of both filesystems while the migration is
underway is recommended. Tools must include a method to validate
successful migration.

*Prerequisites:* Familiarity with Hadoop, Lustre is an advantage.

[[]]
GlusterFS native Windows port
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The applicant should create a native Windows port of GlusterFS using the
Dokan userspace filesystem framework. This consists of the following
major sub-tasks:

1.  a "glue" component to convert in between Windows (path-based) and
POSIX (inode-based) filesystem semantics
2.  make Glusterfs compilable on Windows (possibly relying on POSIX
compatibility frameworks like Cygwin)
3.  make it possible to add Glusterfs as a Windows drive by means of
creating a Dokan filesystem server component

*Prerequisites:* Good programming skills are essential for 1.
Familiarity with filesystems is an advantage for 1. Familiarity with
development on the Windows platform is an advantage for 2. and 3.

[[]]
inode based filesystem backend
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The applicant is expected to design and implement an experimental
low-level filesystem format, based on inodes. That is, in terms of
structure it should resemble disk based filesystems; however, unlike
disk based filesystems, there is no constraint to implement it within a
fixed image device or file (e.g., a directory type inode can be
represented by a real directory, inodes contained in the directory can
be represented by symlinks in this directory).

* propose a design of the filesystem format, with taking care about
atomicity of operations where it's possible, at least, safety of
operations where atomicity is not possible (i.e. design should be
resilient to data loss), and extensibility
* implement a prototype storage translator for this filesystem format
* implement utilities for migration (from and to) and maintainance
(alternatively, such functionality can be included in the translator)

*Prerequisites:* Good programming skills, insight for design work will
be helpful, familiarity with filesystems is an advantage.

Distributed lsof/fuser/showmount command for GlusterFS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Many a times, a process might keep a file open from a client preventing
a user from deleting this file or take the volume offline. When we
encounter this on a local system, its easy to check the process holding
the file open and can be stopped by using the lsof of fuser command.

We want a distributed lsof/fuser/showmount command to do this for
GlusterFS since GlusterFS keeps track of client/pid pairs for files.

*Prerequisites:* Good C programming skills.
