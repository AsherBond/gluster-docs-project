You can expand volumes, as needed, while the cluster is online and
available. For example, you might want to add a brick to a distributed
volume, thereby increasing the distribution and adding to the capacity
of the GlusterFS volume.

Similarly, you might want to add a group of bricks to a distributed
replicated volume, increasing the capacity of the GlusterFS volume.

*Note:* When expanding distributed replicated and distributed striped
volumes, you need to add a number of bricks that is a multiple of the
replica or stripe count. For example, to expand a distributed replicated
volume with a replica count of 2, you need to add bricks in multiples of
2 (such as 4, 6, 8, etc.).

*To expand a volume*

1.  On the first server in the cluster, probe the server to which you
want to add the new brick using the following command: +
 +
# gluster peer probe _HOSTNAME_ +
 +
For example: +
 +
# gluster peer probe server4 +
Probe successful +
 +
2.  Add the brick using the following command: +
 +
# gluster volume add-brick _VOLNAME_ _NEW-BRICK_ +
 +
For example, to add server4:/exp4 to test-volume: +
 +
# gluster volume add-brick test-volume server4:/exp4 +
Add Brick successful +
 +
3.  Check the volume information using the following command: +
 +
# gluster volume info +
 +
The command displays information similar to the following: +
 +
Volume Name: test-volume +
Type: Distribute +
Status: Started +
Number of Bricks: 4 +
Bricks: +
Brick1: server1:/exp1 +
Brick2: server2:/exp2 +
Brick3: server3:/exp3 +
Brick4: server4:/exp4 +
 +
4.  Rebalance the volume to ensure that all files are distributed to the
new brick. +
 +
You can use the rebalance command as described in
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Gluster_3.2:_Rebalancing_Volumes[Rebalancing
Volumes].
