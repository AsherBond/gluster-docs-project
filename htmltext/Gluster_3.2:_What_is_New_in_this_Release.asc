The following table lists the features and significant changes that have
been added to the product.

Feature

Description

Geo-replication

GlusterFS Geo-replication provides a continuous, asynchronous, and
incremental replication service from one site to another over Local Area
Networks (LANs), Wide Area Networks (WANs) and across the Internet. +

Using Gluster Geo-replication, you can establish data redundancy in your
storage environment, providing disaster recovery through existing LAN,
WAN, and Internet connections. For more information, see
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Gluster_3.2:_Managing_GlusterFS_Geo-replication[Managing
GlusterFS Geo-replication]

Directory Quota

GlusterFS v3.2 includes the ability to set quota on usage of disk space
by directories or volumes. The storage administrators can control the
disk space utilization at the directory and/or volume level in GlusterFS
by setting limits to allocate disk space at any level in the volume and
directory hierarchy. This is particularly useful in cloud deployments to
facilitate utility billing model. For more information, see
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Gluster_3.2:_Managing_Directory_Quota[Managing
Directory Quota].

Top and Profile

Gluster v3.2 introduces Volume Top and Profile commands to monitor
different parameters of the workload, thereby helping in capacity
planning and performance tuning tasks of the GlusterFS volume. For more
information, see
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Gluster_3.2:_Monitoring_your_GlusterFS_Workload[Monitoring
your GlusterFS Workload].

Enhanced Log Messages

Log messages are enhanced to provide more information during errors. All
log messages with severity Critical (C) or higher will be logged in
'syslog' framework also.
