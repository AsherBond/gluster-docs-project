The terms defined here help you understand the concepts in this
document.

|=======================================================================
|Term |Description
|Access Control Lists |Access Control Lists (ACLs) allows you to assign
different permissions for different users or groups even though they do
not correspond to the original owner or the owning group.

|Brick |Brick is the basic unit of storage, represented by an export
directory on a server in the trusted storage pool.

|Cluster |A cluster is a group of linked computers, working together
closely thus in many respects forming a single computer.

|Distributed File System |A file system that allows multiple clients to
concurrently access data over a computer network

|FUSE |Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) is a loadable kernel module for
Unix-like computer operating systems that lets non-privileged users
create their own file systems without editing kernel code. This is
achieved by running file system code in user space while the FUSE module
provides only a "bridge" to the actual kernel interfaces.

|glusterd |Gluster management daemon that needs to run on all servers in
the trusted storage pool.

|Geo-replication |Geo-replication provides a continuous, asynchronous,
and incremental replication service from site to another over Local Area
Networks (LANs), Wide Area Network (WANs), and across the Internet.

|Metadata |Metadata is defined as data providing information about one
or more other pieces of data.

|Namespace |Namespace is an abstract container or environment created to
hold a logical grouping of unique identifiers or symbols. Each Gluster
volume exposes a single namespace as a POSIX mount point that contains
every file in the cluster.

|POSIX |Portable Operating System Interface [for Unix] is the name of a
family of related standards specified by the IEEE to define the
application programming interface (API), along with shell and utilities
interfaces for software compatible with variants of the Unix operating
system. Gluster exports a fully POSIX compliant file system.

|RAID |Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks”, is a technology that
provides increased storage reliability through redundancy, combining
multiple low-cost, less-reliable disk drives components into a logical
unit where all drives in the array are interdependent.

|RRDNS |Round Robin Domain Name Service (RRDNS) is a method to
distribute load across application servers. It is implemented by
creating multiple A records with the same name and different IP
addresses in the zone file of a DNS server.

|Trusted Storage Pool |A storage pool is a trusted network of storage
servers. When you start the first server, the storage pool consists of
that server alone.

|Userspace |Applications running in user space don’t directly interact
with hardware, instead using the kernel to moderate access. Userspace
applications are generally more portable than applications in kernel
space. Gluster is a user space application.

|Volume |A volume is a logical collection of bricks. Most of the gluster
management operations happen on the volume.

|Volfile |Volfile is a configuration file used by glusterfs process.
Volfile will be usually located at /etc/glusterd/vols/VOLNAME.
