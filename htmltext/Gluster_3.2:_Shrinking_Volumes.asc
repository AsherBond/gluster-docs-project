You can shrink volumes, as needed, while the cluster is online and
available. For example, you might need to remove a brick that has become
inaccessible in a distributed volume due to hardware or network failure.

*Note:* Data residing on the brick that you are removing will no longer
be accessible at the Gluster mount point. Note however that only the
configuration information is removed - you can continue to access the
data directly from the brick, as necessary.

When shrinking distributed replicated and distributed striped volumes,
you need to remove a number of bricks that is a multiple of the replica
or stripe count. For example, to shrink a distributed striped volume
with a stripe count of 2, you need to remove bricks in multiples of 2
(such as 4, 6, 8, etc.). In addition, the bricks you are trying to
remove must be from the same sub-volume (the same replica or stripe
set).

*To shrink a volume*

Remove the brick using the following command:

-------------------------------------------
# gluster volume remove-brick VOLNAME BRICK
-------------------------------------------

For example, to remove server2:/exp2:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# gluster volume remove-brick test-volume server2:/exp2
Removing brick(s) can result in data loss. Do you want to Continue? (y/n)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enter "y" to confirm the operation. The command displays the following:

-----------------------
Remove Brick successful
-----------------------

Check the volume information using the following command:

---------------------------------
# gluster volume info test-volume
Volume Name: test-volume
Type: Distribute
Status: Started
Number of Bricks: 3
Bricks:
Brick1: server1:/exp1
Brick3: server3:/exp3
Brick4: server4:/exp4
