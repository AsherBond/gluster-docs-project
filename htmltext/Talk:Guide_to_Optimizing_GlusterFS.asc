Sorry if it is a wrong place to ask -- but, are there some standard
configurations/examples for GlusterFS?

I've considered useing GlusterFS on parallel (two nodes, 10Gb Ethernet)
centralized fileserver for our HPC clusters (several small ones, tens of
CPUs). So I did a Bonnie++ benchmark using one of the servers (Dual
Opteron, 4GB RAM, SATA disk) and a client (old P4 2.4GHz box, 512MB RAM,
Gigabit Ethernet). I used 8Gb size for the Bonnie++ tests, and tried
either forced flush IO or not (-b option).

Without performance translators, GlusterFS was as good as non-buffered
IO (i.e., sequential reads and writes were about 16000-17000 K/s, either
putc() or block i.o). At the same time, Rewrite and Seek tests were OK
(about 8000 K/s and 170 seeks/s).

Then I applied read-ahead and write-behind translators. Blocked reads
and writes reached over 40000 K/s, which was same or better with
performance of NFS or Lustre 1.6.3; but the Rewrite test of Bonnie++
became much vorse (an order of magnitude, actually, below 800 K/s). So,
is there a solution for this -- can one have it both ways with
GlusterFS, good IO bandwidth and fast rewrite? Thank you!

Dear GlusterFS developers,

I'm considering using GlusterFS on our ner parallel (two nodes, 10Gb
Ethernet) centralized fileserver for our HPC clusters (several small
ones, tens of CPUs). So I did performance tests for the latest GlusterFS
as well as plain NFS and the recent Lustre-1.6.3.

The GlusterFS looks very attractive because I understand that unlike
Lustre, one could use it for non-x86 Linux platforms as well, which we
might have gotted in the near future.

Update: the actual numbers look like this:
