Stripes data across bricks in the volume. For best results, you should
use striped volumes only in high concurrency environments accessing very
large files.

*To configure a striped volume*

1.  Create a trusted storage pool consisting of the storage servers that
will comprise the volume. +
 For more information, see
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Gluster_3.2:_Adding_Servers_to_Trusted_Storage_Pool[Adding
Servers to Trusted Storage Pool]. +
 +
2.  Create the volume using the following command: +
 +
*Note:* The number of bricks should be a equal to the stripe count for a
striped volume.  +
 +
# gluster volume create NEW-VOLNAME [stripe COUNT] [transport tcp | rdma
| tcp,rdma] NEW-BRICK... +
 +
 For example, to create a striped volume across two storage servers: +
  +
# gluster volume create test-volume stripe 2 transport tcp server1:/exp1
server2:/exp2 +
Creation of test-volume has been successful +
Please start the volume to access data. +
 +
3.  (Optional) Set additional options if required, such as auth.allow or
auth.reject. +
 +
For example: +
 +
# gluster volume set test-volume auth.allow 10.* +
 +
*Note:* Make sure you start your volumes before you try to mount them or
else client operations after the mount will hang, see Starting Volumes
for details.  +
