Server from the Trusted Storage Pool>>]

To add servers to the trusted storage pool +

1.  Ensure that the hostnames used to create the storage pool are
resolvable by DNS before probing the servers. +
 +
To add a server to the storage pool, use the following command: +
 +
# gluster peer probe _SERVER_ +
 +
For example, to create a trusted storage pool of four servers, add three
servers to the storage pool from server1: +
 +
# gluster peer probe server2 +
Probe successful +
 +
# gluster peer probe server3 +
Probe successful +
 +
# gluster peer probe server4 +
Probe successful +
 +
 *Note:* Do not self-probe local host (server 1). +
 +
2.  Verify the peer status from the first server using the following
commands: +
 +
#gluster peer status +
Number of Peers: 3 +
 +
Hostname: server2 +
Uuid: 5e987bda-16dd-43c2-835b-08b7d55e94e5 +
State: Peer in Cluster (Connected) +
 +
Hostname: server3 +
Uuid: 1e0ca3aa-9ef7-4f66-8f15-cbc348f29ff7 +
State: Pfde43e-4533-4e33-4f77-ed3984da21ae +
State: Peer in Cluster (Connected) +
 +
Hostname: server4 +
Uuid: 3e0caba-9df7-4f66-8e5d-cbc348f29ff7 +
State: Pfde43e-4533-4e33-4f77-ed3984da21ae +
State: Peer in Cluster (Connected) +
 +

 +
 After peer probe, in the remote machine, the peer machine information
is stored with IP address instead of hostname.
