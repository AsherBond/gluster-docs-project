Gluster offers multiple ways for users to access volumes in a Gluster
storage cluster:

* *Gluster Native Client* -- This method provides high concurrency,
performance and transparent failover. The Gluster Native Client is POSIX
conformant. The native client gives the best performance in write-heavy
situations. For more information, see
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Gluster_3.2_Native_Client_Guide[Gluster
3.2 Native Client Guide].
* *NFS* -- This is the simplest method to implement in most
environments, including all major UNIX-based operating systems such as
GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, and Mac OS X, as well as Windows 7 (Professional and
Up), Windows Server 2003, and others, as it requires no additional
software to be installed. For reading small files (web serving), the
Linux NFS client performs much better than the gluster native client.

3.2 NFS Guide].
* *CIFS* -- This method provides access to volumes when using Legacy
Microsoft Windows as well as SAMBA clients. For more information, see
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Gluster_3.2_CIFS_Guide[Gluster
3.2 CIFS Guide].
