replicate with 5 nodes - and adding more nodes in the future
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hello, we are testing glusterfs 1.2 and I have few questions -  +
  +
  +
1. we are going to store millions of small jpg files that will be read
by webserver - is glusterfs good solution for this ?  +
2. we are going to run both server+clients on each node together with
apache  +
3. replicate *:2  +
  +
the way i think doing replicate is defining on each server 2 volumes and
using AFR:  +
  +
server1: a1, a2  +
server2: b1, b2  +
server3: c1, c2  +
server4: d1, d2  +
server5: e1, e2  +
  +
afr1: a1+b2  +
afr2: b1+c2  +
afr3: c1+d2  +
afr4: d1+e2  +
afr5: e1+a2  +
  +
and then unify = afr1+afr2+afr3+afr4+afr5 with replicate option  +
  +
is this correct way ?  +
and what to do on the future when we add more nodes ? when changing the
afr (adding and changing the couples) making glusterfs  +
redistribute the files the new way ?  +
  +
4. what happens when a hard drive goes down and replaces, the cluster
also redistribute the files ?  +
  +
  +
  +
Thanks, Shai  +

 What am I doing wrong if this error is printed in the logs?

wrong 'type'
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hi Gbruccha, You have given the 'type' option in the volume spec
wrongly. Please see our examples on wiki for available options (or you
can refer to 'docs/' directory in source).
http://www.gluster.org/docs/index.php/GlusterFS_FAQ#What_all_translators_are_available.3F[see
here for 'type' options]

While asking any doubts on GlusterFS, it would be great if you post the
volume spec with the question, which helps the developers to understand
the problem and reproduce it.

Does still not work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hi Amar,

Thanks for your fast response. I took the type information from:
http://www.gluster.org/docs/index.php/GlusterFS_User_Guide#cluster.2Fautomatic-file-replication[GlusterFS
UG #automatic-file-replication]. But the _features/mirror_ results in a
somewhat similar error:

/usr/local/lib/glusterfs/xlator/features/mirror.so: cannot open shared
object file: No such file or directory

'''''

 +
 My configuration is still very incomplete but looks very similar to the
provided sample files.  +

Here we go: +
 +
 ,----[ /etc/glusterfs/glusterfs-client.vol ] +
 | volume client +
 |   type protocol/client +
 |  end-volume +
 | +
 | volume writeback +
 |   type performance/write-back +
 |   subvolumes client +
 | end-volume +
 | +
 | volume readahead +
 |   type performance/read-ahead +
 |   subvolumes writeback +
 | end-volume +
 | +
 | volume afr +
 |   type features/mirror +
 |   #type cluster/automatic-file-replication +
 |   option replicate:* 2 +
 | end-volume +
 `----  +
 +

,----[ cat /etc/glusterfs/glusterfs-server.vol ]  +
 | volume brick +
 | end-volume +
 |  +
 | volume server +
 |   type protocol/server +
 |   subvolumes brick +
 | end-volume +
 `----

 +
 What I am looking for is a configuration which makes my two nodes high
available. If one dies the other should still have a copy of the data.
If the dead node comes back then it shall automatically resynchronize
itself. To admit, I have not yet figured out if this is possible with
GlusterFS. Also what would happen if a split-brain situation arises? +
 +
 Thanks!  +

performance/mirror not yet there :|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Actually mirror translator is not yet implemented :| its in our road map
we should be finishing it by another 15 days. as of now, to cluster
filesystems we have only cluster/unify translator.

Nested arc. bug
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There's a bug with archives. My configuration:

brick1 brick2 brick3 in afr1 \ brick4 brick5 brick6 in afr2 \ afr1 afr2
in stripe (1MB block)

fuse 2.7.2gfs8 glusterfs 1.3.7 all from debian pakage:
http://lmello.virt-br.org/debian[http://lmello.virt-br.org/debian]
distr. Ubuntu server 7.10

when i tried to do tar fxvj (or xvj) on linux-<KERNEL_VERSION>.tar.bz2
it causes an error and created a fake directory that i was unable to
delete from mounted GlusterFS untill i've deleted it in brick's real
folders. however bzip2 -d on linux-<KERNEL_VERSION>.tar.bz2 worked just
fine and then tar x on linux-<KERNEL_VERSION>.tar worked fine too. so i
guess that that's an issue in nested archives only. i'm planning to give
this configuration a try in a production environment a bit later. and
one more question... can i use .limits.min-free-disk with a stripe or
stripe with schedulers that can give me a bit more options besides block
size? unify is ok when u have a lot of small files but if u have a lot
of large files a stripe is must.
