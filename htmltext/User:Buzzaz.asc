I am a communicator who finds it necessary to remain a
multi-disciplinarian. My strength of a technical background and
communications expertise has been refined over a decade of management
consulting.

Always leveraging my technical background to help technology folk
communicate with the business side, I have become a community manager in
the process. I have been fortunate to contribute leadership to efforts
as worthy as http://CLSWest.us[Community Leadership Summit -West] ('10 &
'11), http://www.meetup.com/facebookmeetup/[Facebook Developers'
Meetup], http://www.meetup.com/TwitterMeetup/[Twitter Meetup], and a few
other communities I have now extricated myself from.

I have learned through experience to keep in mind the potential
eventuality of letting a community go, when I begin engaging it. I do so
effectively by identifying, allying with, & developing champions to
ensure that the work I do continues on. This is best done by creating
alliances with like-minded users with whom shared leadership replicates
functionality. These 'co-leaders' are thus empowered in realms where
they feel sufficient ownership to continue the work done. This way, the
community finds itself enriched from my involvement.
(http://OPENsiliconValley.org[OPEN Silicon Valley] and
http://TotalVitality.org[Total Vitality] are examples of this.)

Being a co-founder of
http://groups.google.com/group/CloudComputingPakistan[Cloud Computing
Pakistan], and facilitator of now-delayed unconferences
http://CloudCamp.org/Karachi[Cloud Camp Karachi] &
http://CloudCamp.org/Lahore[Cloud Camp Lahore], I see the necessity of
developing greater value within myself, as well as skill in niche realms
I can gain expertise in. This is part of the reason I am joining this
forum, and hope to become a valuable member of its working groups, as I
increase my own value.
