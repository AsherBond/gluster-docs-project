Why?
----

Today there are so many variables which Gluster developers need to
address to make GlusterFS seemlessly usable in Huge Deployments. The
effort here is to reduce all of these variables to minimal, or none,
with the introduction of Gluster Storage System.

When?
-----

Tentative dates are not fixed yet, but usable version by mid-June 2008

What?
-----

Gluster Storage System (GSS) will have two components,

* Installer: This will be used to install the image. The initial
versions will contain automatic installer, which will install the image
without asking questions. This can be usable on a completely new storage
box. Later Versions will come with custom installer support (Q3,2008).
* OS image: This will come with pre-compiled GlusterFS and all the
required packages. There can be multiple images, each for different
verticals (like Web2.0, content delivery, Oil&Gas industry).
