tested extensively.

 *File System Requirements*

Gluster recommends Ext4 (for Linux kernel >= 2.6.31 or CentOS >= 5.4)
and Ext3 (for all earlier versions) when formatting the disk sub-system.
For workloads involving large files (> 100GB) in CentOS 5.6 or higher,
gluster recommends XFS file system. Any other POSIX compliant disk file
system, such as ReiserFS may also work, but has not been tested widely.
