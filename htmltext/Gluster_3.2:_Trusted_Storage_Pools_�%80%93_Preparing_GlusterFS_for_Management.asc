Servers to Trusted Storage Pool>>]

A storage pool is a trusted network of storage servers. When you start
the first server, the storage pool consists of that server alone. To add
additional storage servers to the storage pool, you can use the probe
command from a storage server that is already trusted.

*Note:* The GlusterFS service must be running on all storage servers
that you want to add to the storage pool. See
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Gluster_3.2:_Starting_the_glusterd_Daemon[Starting
the GlusterFS Service] for more information. +
