Although we plan/design/code GlusterFS to behave ideally for any weird
idea you can think of, its still much better if the users follow the
best practises below to get the best out of GlusterFS.

* Once the process starts, be sure that you dont have any errors in the
logs (_/var/log/glusterfs.log_ or _/var/log/glusterfsd.log_). The
default log level is 'Warning'. Mostly GlusterFS translators will be
logging errors in the system to the logfile. Monitoring the log files is
a nice practice.

* One process for one export works best with the current codebase.
(Sharing a namespace export in the same server is not a problem).

*
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php?title=GlusterFS_Translators_v1.3&action=edit&redlink=1['posix-locks'
translator] works as desired only on server side. (rather, just above
the
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php?title=GlusterFS_Translators_v1.3&action=edit&redlink=1[storage/posix
translator]).

* Use
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php?title=GlusterFS_Translators_v1.3&action=edit&redlink=1['io-threads'
translator] on server side to give more responsiveness to GlusterFS
mounts.

* Whenever possible, use
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php?title=GlusterFS_Translators_v1.3&action=edit&redlink=1['cluster/*'
translators] on the client side (they can be usable on server side
without problem).

* When using
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php?title=GlusterFS_Translators_v1.3&action=edit&redlink=1['afr'
(automatic file replication)], make sure that the underlying filesystems
have equal available disk space.

* Start with empty export directories when using the
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php?title=GlusterFS_Translators_v1.3&action=edit&redlink=1['stripe'
translator] for the first time. Whenever the number of subvolumes
changes for
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php?title=GlusterFS_Translators_v1.3&action=edit&redlink=1[stripe],
start from an empty export.

* If '/mnt/sda1' is your export disk, it is nice if you export
'/mnt/sda1/export/' through glusterfs, instead of exporting /mnt/sda1
itself. That way, you can have multiple directories from the same disk
exported and it can save you from a possible headache in the future of
having to create new export directories.

* Run 'setfattr -n user.key -v value /<exportdirectory>' as a user (not
as 'root') and if it runs successfully, fine. Otherwise, check
'user_xattr' flag in mounting that partition.

*NOTE:* Above mentioned points are just advises and not the limitations
of GlusterFS. You can choose, not to follow them and still it should
work fine.

*TODO:* Remove this page soon, let GlusterFS init() check for all these
requirements. Hence User will not be bothered about remembering all
these points.
