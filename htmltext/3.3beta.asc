Two of the biggest features of this release are:

compatibility for Apache Hadoop] - With the 2nd beta release of the
upcoming GlusterFS 3.3, we added the ability to use GlusterFS as the
backend data store for Apache Hadoop.

allows admins to utilize the same data store for both POSIX-style mounts
as well as S3 or Swift-compatible APIs.
