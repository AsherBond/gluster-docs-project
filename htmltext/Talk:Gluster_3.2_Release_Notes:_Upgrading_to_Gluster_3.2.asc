On the recommendation to upgrade one instance of a replicated system
first and then confirm stability, are there particular things to look
for to make that confirmation? Is there subtle stuff to check, or is the
confirmation just seeing that it generally seems to work? What's a good
series of confirmation steps to take?

The intention behind that statement seems to have been more general.
You're right, though, that the tests expected should be better
documented.
