Vipul Nayyar
~~~~~~~~~~~~

I am a Computer Engineering student currently studying in
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamia_Millia[Jamia Millia Islamia] , New
Delhi. I'm always on the lookout to learn new technologies and solve
challenging problems.  +

I'm an ardent Linux Enthusiast and FOSS Promoter. After initially
starting using Linux, I switched to many distros, time after time, but
since I started using Fedora, there was no turning back. Fedora offers a
very stable operating system to the end user, and at the same time, a
very diverse and helpful community to anyone who wishes to be a part of
it.  +

Who Am IÂ ?

* A CORE active Member of *JMILUG* (*J*amia *M*illia *I*slamia - *L*inux

Me and my team of JMILUG, a diverse group of Open Source Enthusiasts,

various workshops throughout the year.  +

* *Hacker* at Heart

I love building new stuff and hacking my way through to solve a really
messy problem. Be it any Hackathon, or a Tech Meetup in New Delhi,
You're bound to find me in almost all the events. I really love spending
my time at 24 or 48 hour long Hackathons, building or coding, the
weekend away.
