This section describes the new features available in Gluster v3.2. These
features include:

* Gluster Geo-replication +
GlusterFS Geo-replication provides a continuous, asynchronous, and
incremental replication service from one site to another over Local Area
Networks (LANs), Wide Area Networks (WANs) and across the Internet. +
 Using Gluster Geo-replication, you can establish data redundancy in
your storage environment, providing disaster recovery through existing
LAN, WAN, and Internet connections. For more information, see
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Gluster_3.2:_Managing_Gluster_Geo-replication[Managing
Gluster Geo-replication]. +
 +
* Directory Quota +
GlusterFS v3.2 includes the ability to set quota on usage of disk space
by directories or volumes. The storage administrators can control the
disk space utilization at the directory and/or volume level in GlusterFS
by setting limits to allocatable disk space at any level in the volume
and directory hierarchy. This is particularly useful in cloud
deployments to facilitate utility billing model. For more information,
see
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Gluster_3.2:_Managing_Directory_Quota[Managing
Directory Quota]. +
 +
* Gluster Volume Profile and Top commands +
Gluster v3.2 introduces Volume Top and Profile commands to monitor
different parameters of the workload, thereby helping in capacity
planing and performance tuning tasks of the GlusterFS volume. For more
information, see
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Gluster_3.2:_Monitoring_your_GlusterFS_Workload[Monitoring
your GlusterFS Workload]. +
 +
* Enhanced Log Messages +
Log messages are enhanced to provide more information during errors. All
log messages with severity Critical (C) or higher will be logged in
'syslog' framework also. +
