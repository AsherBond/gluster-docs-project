For performance reasons, quota caches the directory sizes on client. You
can set timeout indicating the maximum valid duration of directory sizes
in cache, from the time they are populated.

For example: If there are multiple clients writing to a single
directory, there are chances that some other client might write till the
quota limit is exceeded. However, this new file-size may not get
reflected in the client till size entry in cache has become stale
because of timeout. If writes happen on this client during this
duration, they are allowed even though they would lead to exceeding of
quota-limits, since size in cache is not in sync with the actual size.
When timeout happens, the size in cache is updated from servers and will
be in sync and no further writes will be allowed. A timeout of zero will
force fetching of directory sizes from server for every operation that
modifies file data and will effectively disables directory size caching
on client side.  +

 *To update the memory cache size*

* Update the memory cache size using the following command: +
 +
# gluster volume set VOLNAME features.quota-timeout _Value_ +
 +
 For example, to update the memory cache size for every 5 seconds on
test-volume: +
 +
# gluster volume set test-volume features.quota-timeout 5 +
 +
Set volume successful  +
