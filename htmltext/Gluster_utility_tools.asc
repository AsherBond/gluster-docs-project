customize-net:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tool is used to customize the network files according to the
current system configuration. The program takes an argument, which
should be the path of the root (/) of installed OS.

Running this tool will change all the network configuration to static
settings as of now, which will be reflected after system reboots in the
native mode.

---------------------------
$ customize-net -h
customize-net OSPATH [ARGS]
$
---------------------------

gdump-netstate:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tools is used to output the commands, which, executed on the
system, can get the same network status back. If a file is given as the
argument, the output will be dumped in the file.

-------------------------
$ gdump-netstate -h
gdump-netstate [filename]
$
-------------------------

ghosts:
~~~~~~~

This tool gives three output files, which are used by 'gping' as input
file.

* _/tmp/ghosts/all_hosts_ - contains hostnames of the client nodes
depending on the total number of nodes given.

* _/tmp/ghosts/known_hosts_ - contains hostnames of the client nodes,
for which MACs are egistered. (ie, known clients)

* _/tmp/ghosts/up_hosts_ - contains hostnames of the client nodes, which
are active for this session of installation.

This tool is used by HPC scripts.

ghwprobe:
~~~~~~~~~

This tool dumps the system configuration (cpu speed, no of processors,
ram size, disk size, no of disks), to the stdout, in a specified format.

------------------------------------------------
# ghwprobe
cpu=1300.000 mem=506584:202628 disk=hda:39070090
#
------------------------------------------------

ghwdump:
~~~~~~~~

This tool gets the hardware profile of all the client nodes, and writes
according to their hostname, in different file, in proper format, at the
node from which its running.

gmount:
~~~~~~~

This tool is used to mount the harddisk partitions, as its in the native
OS's /etc/fstab.

It will mount all the partitions on '/tmp/ginstaller/<os_name>'. If
there is more than one OS, all will be mounted.

With '-o' as argument, gmount gives os names as output.

-------------------
$ gmount -h
gmount [-o] [OSKEY]
$
-------------------

gmeta-installer:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tool is used to give out the scripts, based on the spec file
(output of gprobe). These output scripts can be used to install the
system image if run on any system.

If '--auto' option is given, no question will be asked to user, instead
the output files will be generated to replicate the current image.

gpart:
~~~~~~

This tool is used to output the commands (bash shell) which can be used
to create the partition scheme user selects. (from the dialog given)

If run with '--auto' option, this tool gives commands, to get the
partitions as detected by gprobe.

gprobe:
~~~~~~~

This tool is used to probe the system, and get the information about OS
present in it, partitions, boot-loader used etc.

All the tools (EP/HPC) use this as the basic tool to understand about
the system.

gstate-sel:
~~~~~~~~~~~

This tool is used to select a partition to be used to store the gluster
configuration data. It also detects if previously used partition if
present in the system.

gstream:
~~~~~~~~

This tool is used to show the progress bar of the image transfer. This
takes input and output commands as argument with size of the total
transfer.

gimage-dump:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

gimage-sel:
~~~~~~~~~~~

Image selector

gpart-sel:
~~~~~~~~~~

Partition selector

gmountmap:
~~~~~~~~~~
