What happens to my volumes when a server crashes?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I want to know the behavior of the volumes if a server crashes.

Ok the plain, the volumes dies. That is plain and simple.

Mirrored I would hope that it will remain ONLINE even if 1 of the 2
crashes then resync when you bring the server back up. Now if this is
true. Can I set a new server as the 'mirror' in case the HD of the
crashed one is dead and I have to rebuild a new hard drive

This is the trick one I guess, the Stripped. To my understanding, 1 of 4
server crashed, the Volume goes down with it ??? or is there a parity
fail safe feature???

Anyone pulled the plug on a server power cord to test these behavior :)
