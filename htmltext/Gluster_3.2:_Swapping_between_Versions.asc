You can switch between different GlusterFS versions using repo-switch
command. For example, you can switch from version 3.1 to 3.1.3 and then
again switch to version 3.1.2.

*To switch between versions*

1.  Switch to different version using the following command: +
 # gluster-repo-switch <version> +
Complete!  +
 +
*Note:* If you are downgrading from 3.2.x to 3.1.x version, then the new
features are enabled in the default volume files (i.e. new translators).
So after the downgrade, old versions fail to understand the new options
or translators and fail to start. +
 +
 *Work Around:* Before starting downgrade procedure, run the following
commands:  +
# gluster volume reset <VOLNAME> force  +
# gluster volume geo-replication stop MASTER SLAVE +
Now you can downgrade to 3.1.x. +
 +
Run any parameter changing operations on the volume. For example,
operations like # gluster volume set <VOL> read-ahead off and # gluster
volume set <VOL> read-ahead on. +
 +
2.  Restart glusterd using the following command: +
# service glusterd start  +
 +

*Note:* This procedure has to be performed on each server in your
Gluster cluster.
