|Term |Description
|Cluster |A cluster is a group of linked computers, working together
closely thus in many respects forming a single computer.

hold a logical grouping of unique identifiers or symbols. Each Gluster
volume exposes a single namespace as a POSIX mount point that contains
every file in the cluster.

|POSIX |Portable Operating System Interface [for Unix] is the name of a
family of related standards specified by the IEEE to define the
application programming interface (API), along with shell and utilities
interfaces for software compatible with variants of the Unix operating
system. Gluster exports a fully POSIX compliant file system.
