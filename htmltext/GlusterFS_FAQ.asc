What is GlusterFS?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GlusterFS is a clustered file-system capable of scaling to several
peta-bytes. It aggregates various storage bricks over Infiniband RDMA or
TCP/IP interconnect into one large parallel network file system. Storage
bricks can be made of any commodity hardware such as x86-64 server with
SATA-II RAID and Infiniband or GigE interconnect.

What is the problem with existing Cluster File Systems?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most existing cluster file systems are not mature enough for the
enterprise market. They are too complex to deploy and maintain, although
they are extremely scalable and cheap since they can be entirely built
out of commodity OS and hardware.

GlusterFS solves this problem. GlusterFS is an easy to use clustered
file system that meets enterprise-level requirements.

Why is striping bad?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* *Increased Overhead* +
Striping files across multiple bricks and reading/writing them at same
time will cause serious disk contention issues and the performance will
suffer badly as load increases. If you avoid striping, the underlying
filesystem and the I/O scheduler on each brick knows best how to
organize the file data into contiguous disk blocks for optimized read
and write operations.

* *Increased Complexity* +
Striping complicates the design of clustered filesystems badly. Instead
of using the underlying mature filesystem's ability to do block disk
management, you will have to implement another clustered file system
across multiple underlying filesystems (duplication).

* *Increased Risk* +
Loss of a single node can mean loss of entire file system. Imagine how
slow it is to run _fsck_ on hundreds of TBs of data.

In reality, striping introduces more problems than it solves,
particularly when a file system scales beyond hundreds of TBs.

Alternatively when files and folders remain as is, they take advantage
of the underlying file system to do the real block I/O management. A
single file can grow from 4TB to 16TB within a single node. In reality,
files are not of TBs in size. When multiple clients access a same file,
most likely the blocks are already cached in the RAM and sent via
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Direct_Memory_Access[RDMA] to the
clients. GlusterFS takes advantage of high bandwidth low-latency
interconnects such as
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfiniBand[Infiniband].

The GlusterFS AFR (Automatic File Replication) translator does a striped
read to improve performance on mirrored files.

You say striping is bad, but I see a 'cluster/stripe' translator in
GlusterFS, why is it?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Well, let's list a few points.

* Implementing the striping feature was a few days work for the
GlusterFS team, due to its modular design.
* There are a few people/companies who want a striping feature in the FS
as their application uses a single large file (100GB - 2TB).
* If the file is very big (which we don't recommend, though) a single
server gets completely loaded when its accessed, so striping helps to
distribute the load.
* If one uses
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Translators_v1.4#Automatic_File_Replication_Translator_.28AFR.29['cluster/afr']
translator with
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Translators_v1.4#Stripe_Translator['cluster/stripe']
then GlusterFS can provide high availability.

Advantages of GlusterFS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Designed for O(1) scalability and feature rich.
* Aggregates on top of existing filesystems. User can recover the files
and folders even without GlusterFS.
* GlusterFS has no single point of failure. Completely distributed. No
centralized meta-data server like Lustre.
* Extensible scheduling interface with modules loaded based on user's
storage I/O access pattern.
* Modular and extensible through powerful translator mechanism.
* Supports Infiniband RDMA and TCP/IP.
* Entirely implemented in user-space. Easy to port, debug and maintain.
* Scales on demand.

Can GlusterFS store files redundantly?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GlusterFS automatic-file-replication translator does the job.

Minimum system requirements to use GlusterFS?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the client side, GlusterFS requires FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace
http://fuse.sf.net[http://fuse.sf.net]) kernel support. There are no
minimum system requirements as such. It can even run within a system on
local loopback. However, here are a few suggestions.

* *Storage Cluster:* +
A cluster of 4 or more x86-64 servers with SATA-II RAID and Infiniband
interconnect.
* *NAS Server:* +
x86-64 platform, 2GB RAM, SATA-II RAID and gigabit ethernet network
interface card.

You can vary the amount of RAM, type of interconnect (say Infiniband or
GigE), number of processors, number of bricks, amount of storage
capacity per brick, type of disk (say Ultra320 SCSI or SATA II)... all
depending upon your application needs.

What operating systems are supported by GlusterFS?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please refer to "Operating System Requirements"-
http://www.gluster.com/community/documentation/index.php/Storage_Server_Installation_and_Configuration#Operating_System_Requirements[[1]]

Will a client for Windows be made?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently the support is through CIFS, (samba export). But we do have it
in mind to port it natively using WinFUSE. The work will be undertaken
once WinFUSE is stable

What file system semantics does GlusterFS Support; is it fully POSIX
compliant?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GlusterFS is fully POSIX compliant.

Is GlusterFS like parallel NFS?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the user's point of view, YES, but a very different design
internally. The NFS protocol is very old and not very efficient. It is
hard to fix or improve it. The Parallel NFS client is anyway
incompatible with the existing NFS protocol itself. That's why we moved
ahead with a new GlusterFS file system implementation. GlusterFS has an
edge over NFS in both features and performance depending on the
workload.

Is the gluster client or NFS client faster?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It depends on the use case. For reading many small files, i.e. PHP web
serving, the NFS client will perform much better. If the work-load is
write-heavy, the native client will perform better.

Is GlusterFS compatible with NFS or SAMBA?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No. But you can re-export NFS / Samba / CIFS on top of GlusterFS though.

Will GlusterFS be upward compatible?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Q*: Since GlusterFS is so easy to scale, and after large deployments
are setup, when new versions of Gluster come out, will I have to bring
down my GlusterFS to upgrade, or will Gluster work in a heterogeneous
environment where part of the servers can be upgraded to the newer
version and some of the servers run older versions?

*A*: It's true that with newer versions, we are going to introduce new
features. But, considering situations like this, we will be handling
such situations (backward compatibility) but the user may miss the new
features altogether. Hence we recommend that one upgrades to newer
versions. Anyway, we will announce the compatibility break in mailing
list.

The GlusterFS protocol has a version checking mechanism, which checks
for the compatibility of both server and client before making a
successful connection.

*NOTE:* Its very much advised to use the same version of client and
server.

How to interpret GlusterFS versions?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-LEVEL.

* MAJOR changes when compatibility is broken. You can imagine NFSv2,
NFSv3 or Ext2, Ext3 and Ext4 filesystems.
* MINOR changes for every significant release and then goes into a
maintenance phase.
* PATCH-LEVEL changes within a maintenance phase for bug fixes or
insignificant changes.
