GlusterHPC
----------

For GlusterHPC to run, the master-node should be installed with the OS
(GNU/Linux flavours) of users choice. Using GlusterHPC, the
master-node's OS is copied to all the cluster nodes, and later few of
the HPC applications are installed on all the nodes and configured for
the cluster.

Gluster State
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

User need to select a partition to store the gluster-state (data about
cluster size, network details etc). If you are testing HPC and doesn't
want any state to be preserved, you can choose temporary storage.

If a harddrive partition is selected for the gluster-state, while
running HPC for the second time, the following screen will appear. User
can choose to use the previously stored data, or select New partition.

Configure Cluster Details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each entry in the menu can be edited. These data describes whole
cluster.

http://www.gluster.org/images/screen-shots/new/hpc/01cc.png[http://www.gluster.org/images/screen-shots/new/hpc/01cc.png]

Press 'done' to goto next menu.

Node Registry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this step, user need to register node's MAC address, to enable it to
network boot.

Press 'done' to goto next menu.

 +
 *Select the registering method*

If the data about cluster (MAC address of each node) is available in a
file, then user can choose 'file' else he can choose to capture the MAC
address from network.

_NOTE_: Its adviced to have MACs in a file for huge clusters.

 +
 *Turning On Client Nodes*

If user selects the 'network' option in previous menu, this screen is
displayed.

 +
 *Assigning MAC To Nodes*

The number in the box will be increasing after each registration. Its
also editable.

http://www.gluster.org/images/screen-shots/new/hpc/mac1-new.png[http://www.gluster.org/images/screen-shots/new/hpc/mac1-new.png]

_NOTE_: Always Node number '1' is assigned to master-node. So, the node
numbering will always start from '2'.

 +
 *Registering Nodes*

This is the display while the program is searching for more MACs in the
network.

_NOTE_: If the number of nodes in the cluster is more than what needs to
be installed through HPC (as given in the Cluster configuration
previously), press 'Ctrl-C' to come out of it.

Image Selector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Image of the OS from the node given in the box will be installed in all
the other nodes.

http://www.gluster.org/images/screen-shots/new/hpc/05img-sel.png[http://www.gluster.org/images/screen-shots/new/hpc/05img-sel.png]

Active Nodes
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once we select the required OS and partitions, before continuing with
installing images on all the nodes, we have to make sure that all the
required client nodes are booted up with the gluster slave image.

All the nodes listed here are booted up and ready to get the image.

http://www.gluster.org/images/screen-shots/new/hpc/node1-new.png[http://www.gluster.org/images/screen-shots/new/hpc/node1-new.png]

Press 'OK' after you have all the required nodes listed here.

Partition Selector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the details about the cluster is collected, now user will be
prompted a checklist with the partitions available in the current image.

GStreamer
^^^^^^^^^

A progress bar will appear on the screen, which shows what amount of
image is installed at client nodes.

HPC Extentions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This checkbox menu contains the name of the HPC application we are
providing with GlusterHPC package. Select the required packages, which
actually installs them in all the client nodes, and generates
configuration scripts for each of them.

_NOTE_: mailto: _gluster-devel@nongnu.org_ for more details.

Report
^^^^^^

Report of the total installation will be shown at the end.

http://www.gluster.org/images/screen-shots/new/hpc/10report.png[http://www.gluster.org/images/screen-shots/new/hpc/10report.png]

Press 'Details' to get the detailed report of the installation (per node
details).
