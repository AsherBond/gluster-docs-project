*Translator debug/trace*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The trace translator produces extensive trace information for debugging
purposes. The debug information is written to the GlusterFS log file,
which by default is found in /var/log/gluster/glusterfs.log. Trace
volume can be inserted or layered on top of any volume that needs to be
debugged. All the calls are logged with their arguments/values.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Export volume "brick" with the contents of "/home/export" directory.
volume brick
  type storage/posix                   # POSIX FS translator
  option directory /home/export        # Export this directory
end-volume

### Trace storage/posix translator.
volume trace
  type debug/trace
  subvolumes brick
#  option include open,close,create,readdir,opendir,closedir
#  option exclude lookup,read,write
end-volume
------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Notes:*

* If you want to trace only few calls through the trace translator, use
*"option include <fopslist>"*
* If you want to trace most of the calls, use *"option exclude
<fopslist>"*.
