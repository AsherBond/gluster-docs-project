*Translator protocol/client*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Client translator allows you to attach to remote volumes exported by
GlusterFS servers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
### Add client feature and attach to remote subvolume of server1
volume client1
  type protocol/client
  option transport-type tcp              # for TCP/IP transport
  option remote-subvolume brick          # name of the remote volume
end-volume
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* *transport-type*

This option specifies the type of transport to use for reaching the
server. They can be *tcp*, *ib-sdp*, *ib-verbs* or *unix*

* *remote-host*

This option specifies the hostname or IP address of the remote server.

* *remote-port*

This option specifies the port number on the remote host to connect to.
The default value depends on the transport used (6996 for *tcp* and 6997
for *ib-verbs*)

* *username* and *password*

These are the specification of authentication information when the
*login* auth module is used on the server.

* *remote-subvolume*

Since the server can export multiple volumes, this selects the volume
name to connect to.

* *frame-timeout*

This is the timeout value for operation frames to be considered dead
before the return. The default is 1800 seconds. Keep this high.

* *ping-timeout*

This is the timeout in which the server should respond for internal ping
operations. The purpose of this option is to disconnect unresponsive
servers immediately. The default is 10 seconds.

Client protocol also uses same transport modules that are listed in
server protocol volume, above.
