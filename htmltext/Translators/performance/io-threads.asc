*Translator performance/io-threads*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

IO-threads add asynchronous (background) file system operations. By
loading this translator, you can utilize the server idle blocked time to
handle new incoming requests. CPU, memory, and the network are not
utilized when the server is blocked on read or write calls while doing
direct memory access on disk. This translator makes the best use of all
the resources under load and improves concurrent I/O performance.
