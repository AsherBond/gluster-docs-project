New CMS
^^^^^^^

I'm looking at putting together a demo replacement using
http://mezzanine.jupo.org/[Mezzanine]. I have it installed, have had the
database created but have yet to initialize it or import the data from
wordpress. This is the CMS I use for
http://joejulian.name[joejulian.name]. -

Q&A
^^^

Not all of us like our current Q&A setup. It's difficult to administer.
I would like us to move to something open source so we can help improve
it as necessary and for philosophical reasons. I'm leaning toward
http://www.osqa.net/[OSQA]. -
