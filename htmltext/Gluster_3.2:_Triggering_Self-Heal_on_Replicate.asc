Run the following command from FUSE mount point (on your clients):  +
 +
 # find <gluster-mount> -noleaf -print0 | xargs --null stat >/dev/null
2>/var/log/gluster/<gluster-mount>-selfheal.log

Watch /var/log/gluster<gluster-mount>-selfheal.log for any errors that
may arise; Input/output errors usually indicate a split-brain scenario
that requires manual attention. Note also that directory traversals may
take hours or perhaps days, depending on your configuration and volume
size.
