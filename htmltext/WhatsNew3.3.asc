This is an UNOFFICIAL & tentative list of big new features expected in
the glusterfs 3.3 series.

*New features*

* Unified File & Object access.
* Hadoop hooks - HDFS compatibility layer

*New Volume Type*

* Repstr - replicated + striped (+ distributed) volumes

*Enhancements to Distributed volumes (DHT translator)*

* Rebalance can migrate open files
* Remove-brick can migrate data to remaining bricks

*Enhancements to Replicated volumes (AFR translator)*

* Ability to change replica count on an active volume (possibly
including ability to add replication to distribute-only volumes)
* Granular locking - useful for running VM images needing to be healed.
Glusterfs will not have to lock & freeze the whole VM disk image, only
the parts that need healing.
* Proactive self-heal - when a brick comes back online the gluster
daemon should begin the self-heal process without waiting for the files
to be accessed.
* Round-trip reduction - should improve performance especially for
smaller files.
* Quorum enforcement - should help resolve or avoid split brain
scenarios

Thanks to jdarcy, kkeithley & bulde in #gluster for helping semiosis
with the info for this.
