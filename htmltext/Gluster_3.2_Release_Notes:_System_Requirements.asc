GlusterFS may work with other common Linux distribution like RHEL 5.1 or
higher, Ubuntu 8.04 or higher, and Fedora 11, but has not been tested
extensively.

*File System Requirements*

Gluster recommends Ext4 (for Linux kernel 2.6.31 or higher) and Ext3
(for all earlier versions) when formating the disk sub-subsystem. For
workloads involving huge files, Gluster recommends XFS file system. Any
other POSIX compliant disk file system, such as ZFS may also work, but
has not been tested widely.
