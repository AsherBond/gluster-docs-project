Today, we’re announcing the next generation of GlusterFS, version 3.3.
The release has been a year in the making and marks several firsts: the
first post-acquisition release under Red Hat, our first major act as an
openly-governed project and our first foray beyond NAS. We’ve also taken
our first steps towards merging big data and unstructured data storage,
giving users and developers new ways of managing their data scalability
challenges.

GlusterFS is an open source, fully distributed storage solution for the
world’s ever-increasing volume of unstructured data. It is a
software-only, highly available, scale-out, centrally managed storage
pool that can be backed by POSIX filesystems that support extended
attributes, such as Ext3/4, XFS, BTRFS and many more.

This release provides many of the most commonly requested features
including proactive self-healing, quorum enforcement, and granular
locking for self-healing, as well as many additional bug fixes and
enhancements.

Some of the more noteworthy features include:

* Unified File and Object storage – Blending OpenStack’s Object Storage
API with GlusterFS provides simultaneous read and write access to data
as files or as objects.
* HDFS compatibility – Gives Hadoop administrators the ability to run
MapReduce jobs on unstructured data on GlusterFS and access the data
with well-known tools and shell scripts.
* Proactive self-healing – GlusterFS volumes will now automatically
restore file integrity after a replica recovers from failure.
* Granular locking – Allows large files to be accessed even during
self-healing, a feature that is particularly important for VM images.
* Replication improvements – With quorum enforcement you can be
confident that your data has been written in at least the configured
number of places before the file operation returns, allowing a
user-configurable adjustment to fault tolerance vs performance.
