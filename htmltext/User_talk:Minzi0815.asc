Gluster and RAID
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Does Gluster allow, beside mirroring, also a RAID X - of Glustered
FS's ?

Problem with client in different subnet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We run a test environment that does (gluster) replication over a 11.x -
network and administrative connections via a 10.x network to any of the
gluster hosts. Trying to mount a glusterfs - filesystem from a system
that is not a gluster node and thst is connected over the 10.x - network
only, does not wok. Any advice ?

Thank you in advance,
