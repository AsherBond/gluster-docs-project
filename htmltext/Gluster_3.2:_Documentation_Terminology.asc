|Term |Description
|Distributed File System |A file system that allows multiple clients to
concurrently access data over a computer network.

|FUSE |Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) is a loadable kernel module for
Unix-like computer operating systems that lets non-privileged users
create their own file systems without editing kernel code. This is
achieved by running file system code in user space while the FUSE module
provides only a "bridge" to the actual kernel interfaces.

|glusterd |Gluster management daemon that needs to run on all servers in
the trusted storage pool.

|Gluster Native Client |Gluster Native Client is a POSIX conformant,
FUSE-based client running in user space.

|POSIX |Portable Operating System Interface [for Unix] is the name of a
family of related standards specified by the IEEE to define the
application programming interface (API), along with shell and utilities
interfaces for software compatible with variants of the Unix operating
system. Gluster exports a fully POSIX compliant file system.

|Trusted Storage Pool |A storage pool is a trusted network of storage
servers. When you start the first server, the storage pool consists of
that server alone.

|Userspace |Applications running in user space donâ€™t directly interact
with hardware, instead using the kernel to moderate access. Userspace
applications are generally more portable than applications in kernel
space. Gluster is a user space application.
