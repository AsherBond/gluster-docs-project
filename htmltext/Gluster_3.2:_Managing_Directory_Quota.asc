Directory quotas in GlusterFS allow you to set limits on usage of disk
space by directories or volumes. The storage administrators can control
the disk space utilization at the directory and/or volume levels in
GlusterFS by setting limits to allocatable disk space at any level in
the volume and directory hierarchy. This is particularly useful in cloud
deployments to facilitate utility billing model.  +
  +
 *Note:* For now, only Hard limit is supported. Here, the limit cannot
be exceeded and attempt to use more disk space or inodes beyond the set
limit will be denied. +
  +
 System administrators can also monitor the resource utilization to
limit the storage for the users depending on their role in the
organization.  +
  +
 You can set the quota at the following levels: +

* Directory level – limits the usage at the directory level
* Volume level – limits the usage at the volume level  +
 +

*Note:* You can set the disk limit on the directory even if it is not
created. The disk limit is enforced immediately after creating that
directory. For more information on setting disk limit, see
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Gluster_3.2:_Setting_or_Replacing_Disk_Limit[Setting
or Replacing Disk Limit].
