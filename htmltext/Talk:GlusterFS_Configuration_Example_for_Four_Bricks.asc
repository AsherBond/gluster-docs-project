I noticed while working through this example that it refused to run with
the latest version of glusterfs until after I added an extra namespace
option to the 'unify' section, and another brick to store the namespace.

Maybe that should not be labelled an 'option', and the example should be
somehow reworked to reflect that changeÂ ?
