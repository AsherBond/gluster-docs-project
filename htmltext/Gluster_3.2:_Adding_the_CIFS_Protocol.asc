 You can configure CIFS support for GlusterFS with Samba. To do so, you
need to add corresponding sections to the smb.conf file specifying paths
that point to directories within the GlusterFS mount point.

*To add CIFS support*

* Add a section similar to the following to the smb.conf file: +
 +
[test] +
comment = Sample export via SAMBA +
valid users = user3 +
printable = no +
writable = yes +
public = no +
path = /mnt/gluster/user3_data +
posix locking = yes +
 +
Note that in this example, /mnt/gluster is the mount point.

*Note:* For more information about CIFS on Linux and installing Samba,
check http://www.samba.org/[http://www.samba.org/] as well as the
documentation that came with your distribution.
