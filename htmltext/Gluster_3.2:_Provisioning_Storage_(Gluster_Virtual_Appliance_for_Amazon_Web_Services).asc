You need to add one or more Gluster Virtual Appliance for Amazon Web
Services instances to your initial instance before provisioning storage
in your environment.

 +
 *To provision storage*

1.  Launch a new instance in your Gluster Virtual Appliance for Amazon
Web Services environment using the following command: +
 +
# gluster-ami-newinstance [-n _NUM_] +
 +
where the optional -n _NUM_ parameter launches _NUM_ new instances
together. +
 +
*Note:* The new instances are automatically pre-bootstrapped and peer
probed by this command. +
 +
2.  Create and attach an Amazon EBS volume to the instance using the
following command: +
 +
# gluster-provision-storage [_-t FSTYPE_] [_SIZE_] +
 +
where the optional _SIZE_ parameter represents the size of the volume
(should be multiple of 8 and in GB) and _-t FSTYPE_ parameter represents
the type of the file system. The newly-created volume is formated and
mounted as /export/md_NUM_ using _FSTYPE_. If _FSTYPE_ is not specified,
it defaults to ext3. For more information on _-t FSTYPE_ option, run _#
gluster-provision-storage -h_ command.  +
 +
You need to run this command on each instance. +
 +
 *Note:* gluster-provision-storage script may hang while mkfs is
running. The following is the average completion time: +
 +
*Size*(in GB)     *Time* +
1024          11m19s +
2048          17m49s +
3072          27m28s +
4096          39m50s +
6103          59m22s +
8192          87m01s +
  +
3.  Create additional gluster volumes, as required, using
/export/md_NUM_/subdir as the export directories. +
