You can display status information about a specific geo-replication
master session, or a particular master-slave session, or all
geo-replication sessions, as needed. +
 +
 *To display geo-replication status information* +
 +

* Display information of all geo-replication sessions using the
following command:  +
 +
# gluster volume geo-replication status +
 +
* Display information of a particular master slave session using the
following command:  +
 +
# gluster volume geo-replication _MASTER_ _SLAVE_ status  +
 +
For example, to display information of Volume1 and
example.com:/data/remote_dir +
 +
# gluster volume geo-replication Volume1 example.com:/data/remote_dir
status  +
 +
The status of the geo-replication between Volume1 and
example.com:/data/remote_dir is displayed. +
 +
* Display information of all geo-replication sessions belonging to a
master +
 +
# gluster volume geo-replication _MASTER_ status  +
 +
For example, to display information of Volume1 +
 +
# gluster volume geo-replication Volume1 status  +
 +

 The status of a session could be one of the following:

* *Starting:* This is the initial phase of the Geo-replication session;
it remains in this state for a minute, to make sure no abnormalities are
present.

* *OK*: The geo-replication session is in a stable state.

* *Faulty*: The geo-replication session has witnessed some abnormality
and the situation has to be investigated further. For further
information, see
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Gluster_3.2:_Troubleshooting_Geo-replication[Troubleshooting]
section.

* *Corrupt*: The monitor thread which is monitoring the geo-replication
session has died. This situation should not occur normally, if it
persists contact Gluster
Support/http://community.gluster.org/[Community].
