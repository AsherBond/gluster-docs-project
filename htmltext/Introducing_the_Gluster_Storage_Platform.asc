Gluster Storage Platform is an open source clustered storage solution.
The software is a powerful and flexible solution that simplifies the
task of managing unstructured file data whether you have a few terabytes
of storage or multiple petabytes. Gluster Storage Platform integrates
the Gluster Filesystem, an operating system layer, and a web-based
management interface and installer.

Installation takes less than 10 minutes. It supports native GlusterFS,
CIFS and NFS access protocols and Infiniband, GigE, 10GigE network
interconnects. You can get started with just a single system configured
as a standalone NAS server, and scale from there on as needed.
