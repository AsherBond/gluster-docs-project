OpenShift is FanPaaStic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenShift is Red Hat's open-source, polyglot, and scalable
Platform-as-as-Service (PaaS) solution. It supports Java, PHP, Python,
Node.js, Perl, and Ruby programming languages. On database side it
supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. OpenShift is the best Java
platform as a service solution in the market with support for JBoss AS
7, JBoss EAP 6, and Tomcat 7 servers. In this session, we will first
take a look at what is platform as a service and why you need PaaS. Then
we will learn about OpenShift,its tools, and its eco-system. Next, we
will look at the various interfaces (like command-line, web console,
Eclipse IDE, and REST Api) which you can use to interact with OpenShift.
Finally, we will deploy a Java EE 6 web application to JBoss EAP 6
server running on OpenShift. Goals of this session areÂ :

\1) To make you comfortable with OpenShift 2) To show you how easy it is
to write and deploy applications on OpenShift.
