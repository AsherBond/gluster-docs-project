nation has its own card games, like Dutch klaverjassen. As soon as such
national game appears, almost all social places become occupied with
card players. In Netherlands, klaverjassen is extremely popular in bars
and cafes as well as in clubs. It goes without saying, klaverjassen?is
eagerly played at home. Have you ever happened not to know what to talk
about to your relatives during family holidays? Klaverjassen?s so
helpful in such situations! The only thing you need to do is to get four
people involved and find a piquet deck, i.e. a set of 32 cards with
French sets of Ace, King, Queen, Jack and 7?0. And, finally, you start
to play. Usually, a klaverjassen game consists of 16 deals, and the aim
of every player is to score more. Certainly, points are scored during
the game and summarized at the end. The winner can be counted either by
counting winning the tricks or by counting points per every card having
won the trick. Sometimes you can get additional bonuses at the end,
especially when you win the last trick or the first one, or several
tricks one by one. Is It All about the Dealer? Every klaverjassen game
has its dealer, who shuffles cards and gives a certain amount of cards
to each player. Many people consider being a dealer advantageous, as it
is possible to see your cards and choose trumps adequately. Others
consider being a dealer a possibility to start each trick. On the other
hand, being a dealer makes you be the first one to show your card,
whilst others can wait and see what cards are used in each trick, thus
counting and remembering cards. Anyway, each game has its fans and its
professionals. Inevitably, each professional has his or her own
strategies. Therefore, only practice makes perfect. The more you play,
the more you win. There is only one thing to rememberÂ ?you should always
know your time to stop and quit the game.
