The working copy will have the directory structure layout of the source
tree on which standard text editors (read: emacs) is used to make
modifications. Add and Remove files using:

----------------------
sh$ git add new.c
sh$ git rm old.c
sh$ git mv new.c old.c
----------------------

When changes are complete and unit tested, they will be committed to
your repository. Unlike TLA (and others) where a commit is a movement of
changes from the working copy to the repository, in Git it only updates
the status of your local repository (which is also your working copy.)
Finally use the commit.sh script available in the source to do the
actual commit.

---------------
sh$ ./commit.sh
---------------
