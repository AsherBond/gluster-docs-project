You can export glusterfs mount point as the samba export, and then mount
it using CIFS protocol.

This section describes how to mount CIFS shares on Microsoft
Windows-based clients (both manually and automatically) and how to
verify that the volume has mounted successfully.

*Note:* CIFS access using the Mac OS X Finder is not supported, however,
you can use the Mac OS X command line to access Gluster volumes using
CIFS. CIFS volumes can be accessed in Mac OS X Finder by adding "ea
support = yes, use sendfile = yes, posix locking = no, strict locking =
yes" to the appropriate smb.conf section, but this may cause other
undesired operation.
