Introduction
------------

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law[Moore's law] is applied only to
the computing industry. Unfortunately, the storage industry is very much
left behind even though they are very much a part of the computing
infrastructure. Many data centers are already running into scaling
issues. Investing in more CPUs alone isn't sufficient, because most of
the time nodes wait for data to be read or written to a slow and busy
storage server creating a bottle neck.

GlusterFS precisely solves this problem by borrowing the clustering
concept from the High Performance Computing industry to the storage
industry. GlusterFS clusters multiple independent storage units into one
large storage server to the extent of several peta-bytes and thousands
of clients scalability. Each storage unit has its own CPUs, memory, I/O
bus, RAID storage and interconnect interface. Theoretical peak
performance is the aggregated performance of all the units. GlusterFS is
designed for linear scalability for very large sized storage clusters.

GlusterFS Components
--------------------

GlusterFS Server and Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The GlusterFS server (glusterfsd) allows you to export volumes over the
network. The GlusterFS client (glusterfs) mounts the GlusterFS server
volumes into the kernel VFS. Much of the functionality in GlusterFS is
implemented as Translators.

GlusterFS Translators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Translators are a very powerful mechanism provided by GlusterFS to
extend its file system capabilities through a well defined interface.
Both server and client side translator interfaces are compatible, which
means you can load the same translator on either side. Translators are
binary shared objects (.so) loaded at run-time, based on the volume
specification file. In GlusterFS, even performance enhancements,
extended features and debugging tools are implemented as translators.

The idea of *translator* is borrowed from the *GNU/Hurd*
(http://hurd.gnu.org[http://hurd.gnu.org]) operating system.

Translators v1.4]* lists all of the available translators in GlusterFS.

GlusterFS Transport Modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/GlusterFS_Translators_v1.4#Protocol_Translators[Server
and Client protocol] translators implements transport modules. The
following transport-type are available.

* TCP/IP
* IB-verbs - Infiniband userspace verbs
* IB-SDP - Infiniband socket direct protocol

GlusterFS Scheduler Modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scheduler module is responsible for load balancing across the storage
cluster. Scheduler interface is implemented by

GlusterFS Clustered Storage Design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Storage nodes or servers are called *bricks* because they are the basic
unit in clustered storage.

Conceptualizing Cluster Volume Specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is a pictorial view of server and client volume specification files
for four brick clustered storage.

GlusterFS Server
----------------

The GlusterFS server (glusterfsd) is a deamon which listens for client
connections. Client and server maintain a connection until filesystem is
unmounted.
