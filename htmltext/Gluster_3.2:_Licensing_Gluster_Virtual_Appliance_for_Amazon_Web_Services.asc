 +
# gluster-lic-request +

the current working directory. The license request represents the number
of servers configured in your environment. +
 +
If # gluster-lic-request command fails on the server whose license has
expired, run # yum update command to install updated license manager and
then generate license request. +
 +
3.  Navigate to
http://supportservices.gluster.com[http://supportservices.gluster.com]
and upload the license.req file. +
 +
Gluster returns a validated and signed license file (with file name
license.asc) +
 +
4.  Copy the license.asc file to the server and run the following
command: +
 +
# gluster-lic-install license.asc +
 +
If # gluster-lic-install license.asc command fails on the server whose
license has expired, run # yum update command to install updated license
manager and then install the license. +
  +
5.  Verify that your license was installed successfully. You can use the
following command to display information about your current license: +
 +
# gluster-lic-info +
 +
The command shows details about the current license, including the
number of nodes, expiry date, and so on.

*Note:* You need to regenerate your license request each time you launch
and add a new instance using the gluster-ami-newinstance command.
