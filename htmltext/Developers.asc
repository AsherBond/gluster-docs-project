Contributing to the Gluster community
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Are you itching to send in patches and participate as a developer in the
Gluster community? Here are a number of starting points for getting
involved. We don't require a signed contributor license agreement or
copyright assignment, but we do require a "signed-off-by" line on each
code check-in.

*
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Development_Work_Flow[Developer
Workflow] - this tells you about our patch requirements, tools we use,
and more. Required reading if you want to contribute code.
* http://www.gluster.org/2012/05/glusterfs-license-change/[License
Change] - we recently changed the client library code to a dual license
under the GPL v2 and the LGPL v3 or later

Release Planning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GlusterFS is transitioning to a 6-month release cycle. We recently
convened to plan the 3.4 release, the results of which you'll find in
the link below. This is, of course, subject to change. Look for the next
Gluster Developer Summit in January in (hopefully) Bangalore.

3.4 Release Planning] - this is our evolving roadmap for GlusterFS 3.4

Writing Translators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Translators are the most powerful way to extend GlusterFS. These
stackable modules allow developers to easily add - or remove - features
as they see fit. GlusterFS is, at its core, a toolkit for building new
filesystems, with translators being the building blocks.
