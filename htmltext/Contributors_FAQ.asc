How do I checkout the source?
-----------------------------

Currently development team is following

based development work flow]. Go through the link to get more info.

How do I write a GlusterFS translator?
--------------------------------------

Copy the xlators/debug/trace translator and start replacing the file
system operations that are specific to your translator only. Unmodified
functions, when deleted, will be set to default file system operations
automatically.

How do I submit a bug report?

client/server volume spec files and info about how to reproduce the bug.

How do I submit a patch?
------------------------

http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Development_Work_Flow#Publishing[Patch
submitting guidelines] for git repositories.

Mail the patch as inline mail message to gluster-devel mailing-list with
subject: [PATCH: glusterfs]. Include Changelog contents in the body and
not in patch.

How do I debug GlusterFS?
-------------------------

GlusterFS debug/trace translator when enabled provides a very detailed
log of all internal operations with a complete decoding of values. If
you still can't locate the bug, you can try GNU gdb to debug GlusterFS
code like any other application. GlusterFS runs entirely in user-space.
