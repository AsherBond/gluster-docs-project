Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) is a loadable kernel module for Unix-like
computer operating systems that lets non-privileged users create their
own file systems without editing kernel code. This is achieved by
running file system code in user space while the FUSE module provides
only a "bridge" to the actual kernel interfaces.
