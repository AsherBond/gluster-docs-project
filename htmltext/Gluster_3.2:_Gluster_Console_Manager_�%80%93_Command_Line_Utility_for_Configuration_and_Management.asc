GlusterFS offers a single command line utility known as the Gluster
Console Manager to simplify configuration and management of your storage
environment. The Gluster Console Manager provides functionality similar
to the LVM (Logical Volume Manager) CLI or ZFS Command Line Interface,
but across multiple storage servers. You can use the Gluster Console
Manager online, while volumes are mounted and active.

Using the Gluster Console Manager, administrators can create new
volumes, start volumes, and stop volumes, as required. Administrators
can also add bricks to volumes, remove bricks from existing volumes, as
well as change translator settings, among other operations.

Gluster automatically synchronizes volume configuration information
across all Gluster servers. Administrators can also use the commands to
create scripts for automation, as well as use the commands as an API to
allow integration with third-party applications.

 *Running the Gluster Console Manager*

You can run the Gluster Console Manager on any Gluster storage server.
You can run Gluster commands either by invoking the commands directly
from the shell, or by running the Gluster CLI in interactive mode.

To run commands directly from the shell:

# gluster _<COMMAND>_

*For example:*

# gluster peer status

 +
 To run the Gluster Console Manager in interactive mode

# gluster +

Upon invoking the Console Manager, you will get an interactive shell
where you can execute gluster commands.

# gluster> _<COMMAND>_

*For example:*

# gluster +
# gluster> peer status

*Note:* You can use the gluster command over SSH for remote execution.
