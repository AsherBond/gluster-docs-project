You can configure systems other than Red Hat or Debian to automatically
start the glusterd daemon every time the system boots, add the following
entry to the _/etc/rc.local_ file: +
 +
# echo "glusterd" >> /etc/rc.local

After glusterd is started on all the servers, setup a Trusted Storage
Pool. After trusted pool is established, the GlusterFS server volume
must be created. The glusterfs volume is a logical aggregation of
storage from all the participating servers. The volume thus created can
be seamlessly accessed from clients using NFS or the gluster native
client.

To configure and administer gluster, see
