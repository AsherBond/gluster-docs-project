The following table lists the difference between replicated volumes and
geo-replication:

[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Replicated Volumes |Geo-replication
|Mirrors data across clusters |Mirrors data across geographically
distributed clusters

|Provides high-availability |Ensures backing up of data for disaster
recovery

|Synchronous replication (each and every file operation is sent across
all the bricks) |Asynchronous replication (checks for the changes in
files periodically and syncs them on detecting differences)
