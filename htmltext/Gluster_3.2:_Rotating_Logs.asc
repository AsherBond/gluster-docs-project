Administrators can rotate the log file in a volume, as needed.

*To rotate a log file*

* Rotate the log file by running the following command on any one of the
node: +
 +
# gluster volume log rotate _VOLNAME_ +
 +
For example, to rotate the log file on test-volume: +
 +
# gluster volume log rotate test-volume +
log rotate successful +
 +
*Note:* When a log file is rotated, the contents of the current log file
is moved to _log-file-name_._epoch-time-stamp_.
