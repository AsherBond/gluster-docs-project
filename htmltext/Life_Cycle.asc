Overview
--------

The Gluster Community offers services for each major release of
GlusterFS throughout three life cycle phases â€” Active Development,
Production, Stable.

* Active Development phases last 1 year with release candidates starting
at 6 months
* GlusterFS 3.3 and 3.4 with two years of Production Phase support,
followed by a three year Stable Phase.
* GlusterFS 4.0+ will have three years of Production Phase support,
followed by a four year Stable Phase.

GlusterFS life cycle phases are designed to reduce the level of change
within each major release over time and make release availability and
content more predictable.

-------

During the life cycle of a major release, the Gluster community makes
reasonable efforts to maintain RPC, API, and CLI compatibility across
all minor releases and patch releases. If necessary, the Gluster
community may make exceptions to this compatibility goal for critical
impact security or other significant issues. Furthermore, major releases
of GlusterFS contain a limited set of backward-compatible libraries
included in previous major releases to allow for the easy migration of
applications. Typically, the Gluster community applies changes in such a
way as to minimize the amount of change and to maintain RPC
compatibility. Exceptions may apply for controlled re-bases under
certain circumstances.

 +
 Prior to 3.4, minor version updates have required an interruption of
service. The goal is to change that so minor versions updates after 3.4
can be done with no interruption.

Active Development
------------------

During the Active Development phase, new features are added. Release
candidates should start being released 6 months before the developement
cycle ends as testing requirements demand.

Production
----------

During the Production phase, bugs are actively fixed and optimization is
improved. No new features are added during this phase. Patch releases
will be targeted for every 3 months, though crash bugs or other bugs may
prompt earlier patch releases depending on their severity.

 +

Stable
------

During the Stable phase, critical and security bug fixes are backported.
Patch releases will be targeted for every 6 months.
