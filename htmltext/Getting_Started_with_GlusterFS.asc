Introduction
------------

GlusterFS is a powerful network/cluster filesystem written in user
space, and it uses
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace[FUSE]. GlusterFS is
programmable using its
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php?title=GlusterFS_Volume_Specification_v1.3&action=edit&redlink=1[volume
configuration file]. It takes a layered approach to the file system,
where features are added/removed as per the requirement. Though
GlusterFS is a File System, it uses already tried and tested disk file
systems, like ext3, xfs, ZFS, to store the data. It can easily scale up
to peta bytes storage, which is available to user under a single mount
point.

GlusterFS Installation
----------------------

Please refer to
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php?title=Install_GlusterFS_from_Source&action=edit&redlink=1[Installation
Guide] for instructions.

*Note*: GlusterFS requires fuse versions 2.7.x or above. Refer to
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php?title=Guide_to_Optimizing_GlusterFS&action=edit&redlink=1[Tuning
FUSE module] to learn how
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php?title=Install_GlusterFS_from_Source&action=edit&redlink=1[GlusterFS
patched Fuse] can give better I/O performance.

GlusterFS Volume Specification
------------------------------

The volume specification file is a very important component of the
GlusterFS file system and is needed by both the client and server
process. This file defines the behavior of the filesystem. Knowing what
goes in a volume spec file and mastering the art of writing a good spec
file can make you a very good GlusterFS admin/hacker.
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php?title=GlusterFS_Volume_Specification_v1.3&action=edit&redlink=1[GlusterFS
Volume Specification v1.3] provides an overview of writing volume spec
files, and the terminology associated with it.

Even with all of it's
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php?title=GlusterFS_Translators_v1.3&action=edit&redlink=1[advanced
features], GlusterFS is very easy to setup and manage.

Here are some
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php?title=GlusterFS&action=edit&redlink=1[volume
file examples] that may help you get more of an idea of what volume spec
files look like.

Going Live
----------

For complete list of GlusterFS command line options, follow
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php?title=GlusterFS_Command-line_Arguments&action=edit&redlink=1[GlusterFS
Command-line Arguments]

Starting the server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With a properly configured volume specification file for the server, you
can start it like:

---------------------------------------------------
$ glusterfsd -f /etc/glusterfs/glusterfs-server.vol
---------------------------------------------------

This takes _/etc/glusterfs/glusterfs-server.vol_ as the server volume
spec file. If you have server volume spec file in different filename,
then try the following thing.

---------------------------------------------
$ glusterfsd -f /path/to/glusterfs-server.vol
---------------------------------------------

Mounting the client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the server is started or client volume specification is ready, you
can mount the filesystem. Refer to
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php?title=Mounting_a_GlusterFS_Volume&action=edit&redlink=1[Mounting
a GlusterFS Volume].
