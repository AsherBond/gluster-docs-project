You can set volume options, as needed, while the cluster is online and
available.

*To set volume options*

* Set volume options using the following command: +
 +
# gluster volume set _VOLNAME_ _OPTION_ _PARAMETER_ +
 +
The following lists the options you can set:

# gluster volume set test-volume performance.cache-size 256MB +
Set volume successful

The following table lists the Volume options along with its description
and default value:

Note: The default options given here are hard coded in the source file
and is subject to modification at any given time. The following default
values may not be the same for all versions.

*Option*

*Description*

*Default Value*

cluster.self-heal-window-size

Specifies the number of maximum number blocks per file for which
self-heal process would be applied simultaneously.

16

cluster.data-self-heal-algorithm

Selects between "full", "diff", and reset. The "full" algorithm copies
the entire file from source to sinks. The "diff" algorithm copies to
sinks only those blocks whose checksums don't match with those of
source. Reset uses a heuristic model.

If the file does not exist on one of the subvolumes, or a zero-byte file
exists (created by entry self-heal) the entire content has to be copied
anyway, so there is no benefit from using the "diff" algorithm.

If the file size is about the same as page size, the entire file can be
read and written with a few operations, which will be faster than "diff"
which has to read checksums and then read and write.

reset

cluster.min-free-disk

Specified the percentage of disk space that must be kept free.

Might be useful for non-uniform bricks.

0%

cluster.stripe-block-size

Specifies the size of the stripe unit that will read from or written to
the striped servers.

Optionally different stripe unit sizes can be specified for different
files, with the following pattern <filename-pattern:blk-size>.

128 KB (for all files)

cluster.quorum-type

Method used for quorum enforcement. "None" means no quorum enforcement,
which is the historical behavior. "Auto" means quorum is set to be more
than half of the bricks in a subvolume, or exactly half if that includes
the first listed brick. "Fixed" means quorum is set to a value specified
by link:#cluster.quorum-count[cluster.quorum-count]. If quorum is not
met, then modifing operations such as _write_ will fail with EROFS. This
prevents most cases of "split brain" which result from conflicting
writes to different bricks.

None

cluster.quorum-count

Number of subvolumes that must be present to achieve quorum, as
described for link:#cluster.quorum-type[cluster.quorum-type]. This value
is not used unless _cluster.quorum-type_ is "fixed".

0

diagnostics.brick-log-level

Changes the log-level of the bricks.

INFO

diagnostics.client-log-level

Changes the log-level of the clients.

INFO

performance.cache-max-file-size

Sets the maximum file size cached by the io-cache translator. Can use
the normal size descriptors of KB,MB,GB,TB or PB (ie. 6GB). Maximum size
uint64.

18,446,744,073,709,551,615B

performance.cache-min-file-size

Sets the minimum file size cached by the io-cache translator. Same as
"max" above.

0B

performance.cache-refresh-timeout

The cached data for a file will be retained till 'cache-refresh-timeout'
seconds, after which data re-validation is performed.

1 sec

network.frame-timeout

The time frame after which the operation has to be declared as dead, if
the server does not respond for a particular operation.

1800 (30 mins)

network.ping-timeout

The time duration for which the client waits to check if the server is
responsive.

When a ping timeout happens, there is a network disconnect between the
client and server. All resources held by server on behalf of the client
get cleaned up. When a reconnection happens, all resources will need to
be re-acquired before the client can resume its operations on the
server. Additionally, the locks will be acquired and the lock tables
updated.

This reconnect is a very expensive operation and should be avoided at
the cost of client wait time for a network disconnect.

42 sec

auth.allow

'IP addresses/Host name' of the clients which should be allowed to
access the the volume.

* (allow all)

auth.reject

'IP addresses/Host name' of the clients which should be denied to access
the volume.

NONE (reject none)

performance.cache-size

Size of the read cache.

32 MB

performance.write-behind-window-size

Size of the per-file write-behind buffer.

1 MB

performance.io-thread-count

The number of threads in IO threads translator.

16

performance.flush-behind

If this option is set ON, instructs write-behind translator to perform
flush in background, by returning success (or any errors, if any of
previous writes were failed) to application even before flush is sent to
backend filesystem. By default, this option is on.

ON

diagnostics.latency-measurement

Statistics related to the latency of each operation would be tracked
inside GlusterFS data-structures.

off

diagnostics.dump-fd-stats

Statistics related to file-operations would be tracked inside GlusterFS
data-structures.

off

nfs.disable

Turn-off export of volume through NFS

off

nfs.enable-ino32

For 32-bit nfs clients or applications that do not support 64-bit inode
numbers or large files. Use this

option from the CLI to make Gluster NFS return 32-bit inode numbers
instead. Applications that will benefit are those that were either:

* Built 32-bit and run on 32-bit machines.
* Built 32-bit on 64-bit systems.
* Built 64-bit but use a library built 32-bit, especially relevant for
python and perl scripts.

This option is disabled by default so NFS returns 64-bit inode numbers
by default. Either of the conditions above can lead to application on
Linux NFS clients failing with "Invalid argument" or "Value too large
for defined data type" errors.

off

nfs.volume-access

Set the access type for the specified sub-volume.

read-write

nfs.trusted-write

If there is an UNSTABLE write from the client, STABLE flag will be
returned to force the client to not to send a COMMIT request.  +
 +
In some environments, combined with a replicated GlusterFS setup, this
option can improve write performance. This flag allows users to trust
Gluster replication logic to sync data to the disks and recover when
required. COMMIT requests if received will be handled in a default
manner by fsyncing. STABLE writes are still handled in a sync manner.

off

nfs.trusted-sync

All writes and COMMIT requests are treated as async. This implies that
no write requests are guaranteed to be on server disks when the write
reply is received at the NFS client. Trusted sync includes trusted-write
behavior.

off

nfs.export-dir

By default, all sub-volumes of NFS are exported as individual exports.
Now, this option allows you to export only the specified subdirectory or
subdirectories in the volume. This option can also be used in
conjunction with nfs3.export-volumes option to restrict exports only to
the

subdirectories specified through this option. You must provide an
absolute path.

Enabled for all sub directories.

nfs.export-volumes

Enable/Disable exporting entire volumes, instead if used in conjunction
with nfs3.export-dir, can allow setting up only subdirectories as
exports.

on

nfs.rpc-auth-unix

Enable/Disable the AUTH_UNIX authentication type. You must enable this
option for better interoperability. However, you can disable it if
required.

on

nfs.rpc-auth-null

Enable/Disable the AUTH_NULL authentication type. You must always enable
this option.

on

nfs.rpc-auth-allow<IP- Addresses>

Allow a comma separated list of addresses and/or hostnames to connect to
the server. By default, all clients are disallowed. This allows you to
define a general rule for all exported volumes.

Reject All

nfs.rpc-auth-reject _IP- Addresses_

Reject a comma separated list of addresses and/or hostnames from
connecting to the server. By default, all connections are disallowed.
This allows you to define a general rule for all exported volumes.

Reject All

nfs.ports-insecure

Allow client connections from unprivileged ports. By default only
privileged ports are allowed. This is a global setting in case insecure
ports are to be enabled for all exports using a single option.

off

rpc-auth-allow-insecure

Allow client connections from unprivileged ports. By default only
privileged ports are allowed. This is a global setting in case insecure
ports are to be enabled for all exports using a single option.

on

nfs.addr-namelookup

Turn-off name lookup for incoming client connections using this option.
In some setups, the name server can take too long to reply to DNS
queries resulting in timeouts of mount requests. Use this option to turn
off name lookups during address authentication. Note, turning this off
will prevent you from using hostnames in rpc-auth.addr.* filters.

on

nfs.enable-ino32

For NFS clients or apps that do not support 64-bit inode numbers, use
this option to make NFS return 32-bit inode numbers instead. Disabled by
default so NFS returns 64-bit inode numbers by default.

off

nfs.register-with- portmap

For systems that need to run multiple NFS servers, you need to prevent
more than one from registering with portmap service. Use this option to
turn off portmap registration for Gluster NFS.

on

nfs.port <PORT- NUMBER>

Use this option on systems that need Gluster NFS to be associated with a
non-default port number.

38465- 38467

geo-replication.indexing

Use this option to automatically sync the changes in the filesystem from
Master to Slave.

off

features.quota-timeout

For performance reasons, quota caches the directory sizes on client. You
can set timeout indicating the maximum duration of directory sizes in
cache, from the time they are populated, during which they are
considered valid. .
