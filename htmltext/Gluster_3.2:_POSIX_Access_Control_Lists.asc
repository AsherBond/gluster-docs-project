*Important:* POSIX ACLs support is available only from version 3.2.2
onwards.

 POSIX Access Control Lists (ACLs) allows you to assign different
permissions for different users or groups even though they do not
correspond to the original owner or the owning group.

For example: User john creates a file but does not want to allow anyone
to do anything with this file, except another user, antony (even though
there are other users that belong to the group john).

This means, in addition to the file owner, the file group, and others,
additional users and groups can be granted or denied access by using
POSIX ACLs.

*Note:* POSIX ACLs behavior varies with kernel versions.
