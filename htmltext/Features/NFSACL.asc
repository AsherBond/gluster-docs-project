Feature

Access Control List - Version 3 support for Gluster NFS.

1 Summary

As NFSv3 protocol specification does not have scope for ACL operations
we need a n RPC program implementation to support it.

Under code-review.

4 Detailed Description

ACL support for NFSv3 is known as NFSACL. It is a separate out of band
protocol (for NFSv3) to support ACL operations (GETACL and SETACL).
There is no formal documentation/rfc on the protocol. The NFSACL rpcgen
.x file was written with the help of the wireshark dump of the packets
between linux-kernel-nfs and linux nfs client.

NFSACL program number is 100227 and version is 3. The program listens on
tcp port 38467.

5 Benefit to GlusterFS

Adds ACL functionality to the NFS.

 6. Scope

6.1. Nature of proposed change

xlators/nfs/server/src/acl3.[ch]

6.2. Implications on manageability

No gluster cli options are provided. By default NFSACL is on. In case we
get a requirement for configuring this we can add a command line option.

6.3. Implications on presentation layer

NFS

6.4. Implications on persistence layer

None.

6.5. Implications on 'GlusterFS' backend

None.

 +
 6.6. Modification to GlusterFS metadata

linux's posix acl implementation uses extended attributes
system.posix_acl_access and system.posix_acl_default. We use the same
extended attributes for GlusterFS NFSACL.

 +
 6.7. Implications on 'glusterd'

None.

7 How To Test

We can reuse the test cases we have to test the fuse-native-client ACL
operations.
