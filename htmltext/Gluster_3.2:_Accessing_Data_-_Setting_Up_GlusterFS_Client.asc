 Gluster offers multiple ways for users to access volumes in a Gluster
storage cluster:

* *Gluster Native Client* - This method provides high concurrency,
performance and transparent failover in GNU/Linux clients. The Gluster
Native Client is POSIX conformant. For accessing volumes using gluster
native protocol, you need to install gluster native client. For more
information,
seehttp://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Gluster_3.2:_Gluster_Native_Client[Gluster
Native Client].
* *NFS* - This method provides access to gluster volumes with NFS v3.
Extensive testing has be done on GNU/Linux clients and NFS
implementation in other operating system, such as FreeBSD, and Mac OS X,
as well as Windows 7 (Professional and Up), Windows Server 2003, and
others, may work with gluster NFS server implementation. You must
install nfs-common package on both servers and clients (only for
Debian-based) distribution. For more information, see
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Gluster_3.2:_NFS[NFS]
* *CIFS* - This method provides access to volumes when using Microsoft
Windows as well as SAMBA clients. For this access method, Samba packages
need to be present on the client side. For more information, see
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Gluster_3.2:_CIFS[CIFS].
