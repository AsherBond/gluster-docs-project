To install Gluster Native Client on RPM distribution-based systems

1.  Install required prerequisites on the client using the following
command: +
 +
$ sudo yum -y install openssh-server wget fuse fuse-libs openib
libibverbs +
 +
2.  Ensure that TCP and UDP ports 24007 and 24008 are open on all
Gluster servers. Apart from these ports, you need to open one port for
each brick starting from port 24009. For example: if you have five
bricks, you need to have ports 24009 to 24014 open. +
 +
You can use the following chains with iptables: +
 +
$ sudo iptables -A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p
tcp --dport 24007:24008 -j ACCEPT +
$ sudo iptables -A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p
tcp --dport 24009:24014 -j ACCEPT +
 +
*Note:* If you already have iptable chains, make sure that the above
ACCEPT rules precede the DROP rules. This can be achieved by providing a
lower rule number than the DROP rule. +
 +
3.  Download the latest GlusterFS core, FUSE, and RDMA RPM files to each
client. +
 +
The core package contains the Gluster Native Client. The optional FUSE
packages contain the FUSE translator for glusterfs native mounting on
client systems and the RDMA packages contain the OpenFabrics verbs RDMA
module for Infiniband. +
 +
You can download the software at
http://www.gluster.org/download[http://www.gluster.org/download]. +
 +
4.  For each RPM file, get the checksum (using the following command)
and compare it against the checksum for that file in the md5sum file. +
 +
$ md5sum _RPM_file_.rpm +
 +
The md5sum of the packages is available at
http://download.gluster.com/pub/gluster/glusterfs[http://download.gluster.com/pub/gluster/glusterfs].
 +
 +
5.  Install Gluster Native Client on the client. +
 +
Use the following commands: +
 +
$ sudo rpm -Uvh _core_RPM_file_ +
$ sudo rpm -Uvh _fuse_RPM_file_ +
$ sudo rpm -Uvh _rdma_RPM_file_ +
 +
For example: +
 +
$ sudo rpm -Uvh glusterfs-core-3.2.0.x86_64.rpm +
$ sudo rpm -Uvh glusterfs-fuse-3.2.0.x86_64.rpm +
$ sudo rpm -Uvh glusterfs-rdma-3.2.0.x86_64.rpm +
 +
*Note:* The RDMA module is only required when using Infiniband.
