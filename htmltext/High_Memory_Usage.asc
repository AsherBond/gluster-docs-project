Glusterfs high memory usage is a
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.gluster.user/2794[recurring
topic of users].

So very briefly, an user-oriented summary on dealing with this issue.

* Most likely, _no special action is needed_. As Glusterfs is serving as
a back-end for a kernel facility, it has some memory allocations which
are instrumented by the kernel, and kernel will garbage collect these
when available memory goes low.
* If you find your system _trashing_ or meet effective memory outage
(OOM killings): it should not happen. It's a _bug_, report it, making
unambigous that you've seen trashing/OOM, not just top was displaying
high memory usage.
* If you don't actually experience anything bad but you are a skeptical
type and want to _make sure_ that all is fine: execute
+
---------------------------------
echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
---------------------------------
+
This triggers the above mentioned kernel gc mechanism on user request.
** _expected result_: glusterfs memory usage goes back to normal
** _otherwise_: glusterfs leaks memory. Send a _bug_ report, making it
unambigous that you did try `echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches` and not
just top was displaying high memory usage.
