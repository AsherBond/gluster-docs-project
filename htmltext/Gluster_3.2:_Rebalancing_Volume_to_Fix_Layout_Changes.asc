Volume to Migrate Existing Data>>]

Fixing the layout is necessary because the layout structure is static
for a given directory. In a scenario where new bricks have been added to
the existing volume, newly created files in existing directories will
still be distributed only among the old bricks. The _# gluster volume
rebalance <VOLNAME> fix-layout start_ command will fix the layout
information so that the files can actually go to newly added nodes too.
When this command is issued, all the file stat information which is
already cached will get revalidated.

A fix-layout rebalance will only fix the layout changes and does not
migrate data. If you want to migrate the existing data, use #gluster
volume rebalance <VOLNAME> migrate-data start command to rebalance data
among the servers.

*To rebalance a volume to fix layout changes*

* Start the rebalance operation on any one of the server using the
following command: +
 +
# gluster volume rebalance _VOLNAME_ fix-layout start +
 +
For example: +
 +
# gluster volume rebalance test-volume fix-layout start +
 Starting rebalance on volume test-volume has been successful +
 +
