I have just seen that Jjulian reverted the changes I made earlier in
this page.

Here is the reproduction of the irc message I just sent him (which he
was unable to answer for lack of irc connection):

"I've just seen that you reverted the changes I made at the
http://europe.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Gluster_3.2:_Brick_Restoration_-_Replace_Crashed_Server[http://europe.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Gluster_3.2:_Brick_Restoration_-_Replace_Crashed_Server]
page. Are you aware that the method you re-published won't create the
necessary bricks in the newly installed server? This method might work
if the adm manually creates the necessary bricks, I'm not sure as I just
got this idea but anyway none of this is mentioned in the above page.
The method I proposed works no matter the adm manually creates the
necessary bricks or not. Is there some reason the method I proposed
shouldn't be used?"

I hope we can understand better this issue so we can present a tested
resync method.

Thinking about this issue I remembered that the re-published method only
works if the new server has the same name as the old one. The method I
proposed works for new servers that have the same name as the old one
AND for new servers that have a different name. Adding this to the "new
brick creation" isssue I mentioned above, it seems to me that the method
I proposed is clearly superior. Are there any caveats in it I'm not
aware of?
