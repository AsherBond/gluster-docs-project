[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Term |Description
|Cluster |A cluster is a group of linked computers, working together
closely thus in many respects forming a single computer.

|Metadata |Metadata is defined as data providing information about one
or more other pieces of data.

|Namespace |Namespace is an abstract container or environment created to
hold a logical grouping of unique identifiers or symbols. Each Gluster
volume exposes a single namespace as a POSIX mount point that contains
every file in the cluster.

|POSIX |Portable Operating System Interface [for Unix] is the name of a
family of related standards specified by the IEEE to define the
application programming interface (API), along with shell and utilities
interfaces for software compatible with variants of the Unix operating
system. Gluster exports a fully POSIX compliant file system.

|Userspace |Applications running in user space donâ€™t directly interact
with hardware, instead using the kernel to moderate access. Userspace
applications are generally more portable than applications in kernel
space. Gluster is a user space application.

|Volume |A volume is a logical collection of bricks. Most of the gluster
management operations happen on the volume.
