If you stop and restart a Gluster virtual appliance, a new IP address
and hostname will be assigned by Amazon Web Services. This may cause the
newly restarted Gluster virtual appliance to be not part of the trusted
storage pool. Rebooting the Gluster virtual appliance, will preserve the
IP address and hostname. This will not cause any disruptions to the
trusted storage pool.
