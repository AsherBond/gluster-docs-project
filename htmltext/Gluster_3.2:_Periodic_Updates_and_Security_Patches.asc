Gluster strongly recommends you to update your Gluster Virtual Appliance
on a regular basis with the latest security patches and upgrades. This
will ensure that your computer is up-to-date with security updates and
upgrades.

*To install updates periodically*

1.  Verify that the base-3.2.repo file exists in /etc/yum.repos.d/
directory. If it does not exist, you can download the file at
http://bits.gluster.com/pub/gluster/base/[http://bits.gluster.com/pub/gluster/base/]
.  +
 +
Note: Downloading base-3.2-repo file is a one-time effort. +
 +
2.  Run the following command to clear yum caches: +
# yum clean all +
 +
3.  Install the periodic updates using the following command: +
# yum update  +
 +
4.  Restart glusterd using the following command: +
# service glusterd start  +
 +

*Note:* This procedure has to be performed on each instance.
