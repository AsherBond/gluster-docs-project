You can apply access ACLs to grant permission for both files and
directories.

* To set or modify Access ACLs, use the following command: +
 +
# setfacl â€“m <entry type> file +
 +

The ACL entry types are the POSIX ACLs representations of owner, group,
and other. +
 +
Permissions must be a combination of the characters r (read), w (write),
and x (execute). You must specify the ACL entry in the following format
and can specify multiple entry types separated by commas.

[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|ACL Entry Type |Description
|u:uid:<permission> |Sets the access ACLs for a user. You can specify
user name or UID.

|g:gid:<permission> |Sets the access ACLs for a group. You can specify
group name or GID.

|m:<permission> |Sets the effective rights mask. The mask is the
combination of all access permissions of the owning group and all of the
user and group entries.

|o:<permission> |Sets the access ACLs for users other than the ones in
the group for the file.
|=======================================================================

If a file or directory already has an POSIX ACLs, and the setfacl
command is used, the additional permissions are added to the existing
POSIX ACLs or the existing rule is modified. +
 +
 For example, to give read and write permissions to user antony: +
 +
 # setfacl -m u:antony:rw /mnt/gluster/data/testfile

 +
