You can view both current open fd count (list of files that are
currently the most _opened_ and the count) on the brick and the maximum
open fd count (count of files that are the currently _open_ and the
count of maximum number of files _opened_ at any given point of time,
since the servers are up and running). If the brick name is not
specified, then open fd metrics of all the bricks belonging to the
volume will be displayed.  +
 +
 *To view open fd count and maximum fd count*  +
 +

* View open fd count and maximum fd count using the following command: +
 +
# gluster volume top <VOLNAME> open [brick <BRICK-NAME>] [list-cnt
<cnt>] +
 +
 For example, to view open fd count and maximum fd count on brick
server:/export of test-volume and list top 10 open calls: +
 +
 # gluster volume top test-volume open brick server:/export/ list-cnt
10 +
 +
Brick: server:/export/dir1 +
 +
Current open fd's: 34 Max open fd's: 209 +
