command: +
 +
# gluster-lic-install license.asc +
 +

license has expired, run # yum update command to install updated license
manager and then install the license.  +

following command to display information about your current license: +
 +
# gluster-lic-info +
 +

number of nodes, expiry date, and so on. +
 +
