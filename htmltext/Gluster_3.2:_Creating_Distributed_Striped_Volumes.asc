Distributed striped volumes stripe data across two or more nodes in the
cluster. For best results, you should use distributed striped volumes
where the requirement is to scale storage and in high concurrency
environments accessing very large files is critical.

*To configure a distributed striped volume*

1.  Create a trusted storage pool consisting of the storage servers that
will comprise the volume. +
 For more information, see
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Gluster_3.2:_Adding_Servers_to_Trusted_Storage_Pool[Adding
Servers to Trusted Storage Pool]. +
 +
2.  Create the volume using the following command: +
 +
*Note:*The number of bricks should be a multiple of the stripe count for
a distributed striped volume.  +
 +
# gluster volume create NEW-VOLNAME [stripe COUNT] [transport tcp | rdma
| tcp,rdma] NEW-BRICK... +
 +
 To create a distributed striped volume across four storage servers: +
  +
# gluster volume create test-volume stripe 4 transport tcp server1:/exp1
server2:/exp2 server3:/exp3 server4:/exp4 +
Creation of test-volume has been successful +
Please start the volume to access data. +
 +
To create a distributed striped volume across eight storage servers: +
  +
# gluster volume create test-volume stripe 4 transport tcp server1:/exp1
server2:/exp2 server3:/exp3 server4:/exp4 server5:/exp5 server6:/exp6
server7:/exp7 server8:/exp8 +
Creation of test-volume has been successful +
Please start the volume to access data. +
 +
3.  (Optional) Set additional options if required, such as auth.allow or
auth.reject. +
 +
For example: +
 +
# gluster volume set test-volume auth.allow 10.* +
 +
*Note:* Make sure you start your volumes before you try to mount them or
else client operations after the mount will hang, see Starting Volumes
for details.  +
