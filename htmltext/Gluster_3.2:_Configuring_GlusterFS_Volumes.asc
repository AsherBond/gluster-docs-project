This section describes how to configure GlusterFS volumes in your
storage environment, using the following common scenarios:

* Distributed - Distributes files throughout the cluster. For more
information, see
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Gluster_3.2:_Configuring_Distributed_Volumes[Configuring
Distributed Volumes].
* Distributed Replicated - Replicates data across two or more nodes in
the cluster. For more information, see
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Gluster_3.2:_Configuring_Distributed_Replicated_Volumes[Configuring
Distributed Replicated Volumes].
* Distributed Striped - Stripes files across multiple nodes in the
cluster. For more information, see
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Gluster_3.2:_Configuring_Distributed_Striped_Volumes[Configuring
Distributed Striped Volumes].

*Note:* Gluster recommends you to set _rpc-auth-allow-insecure_ option
to ON if there are too many bricks in each volume or if there are too
many services which have already utilized all the privileged ports in
the system. Turning this option ON allows ports to accept/reject
messages from insecure ports. So, use this option only if your
deployment requires it. For more information on setting this option, see
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Gluster_3.2:_Setting_Volume_Options[Setting
Volume Options].

*Make sure you start your volumes before you try to mount them or else
client operations after the mount will hang, see
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Gluster_3.2:_Starting_Volumes[Starting
Volumes] for details.*
