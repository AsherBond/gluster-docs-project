Agenda
^^^^^^

*09:00* Welcome and Opening Remarks - Thomas Oulevey, CERN

*09:15-10:15* State of the Gluster Community and Roadmap - John Mark
Walker

GlusterFS is a popular, software-only distributed storage system and the
lynchpin of the Gluster community. Every day, more users and developers
come to appreciate the simplicity, ease of use, and flexibilty of
scale-out storage, GlusterFS style. In this talk, attendees will learn
about the project's history, what's new in the latest release (version
3.4) and what's new in the project roadmap for the 3.5 release, the
community's governance structure and the developer toolset available on
Gluster.org.

GlusterFS 3.4 is almost ready for beta and will soon be ready for GA.
One of the major features of this release is the QEMU integration and
block device translator. This will significantly increase the scope of
possible use cases for GlusterFS. With the QEMU integration, weâ€™re
bypassing FUSE and going through a new client library, libgfapi.

In addition to the QEMU integration, other features coming in 3.4:

* WORM (write once read many)
* Operating version for glusterd
* Block device translator
* Duplicate Request Cache
* Server Quorum
* libgfapi
* NFSv3 ACL support

 *10:30 - 11:30* GlusterFS for Systems Administrators - Dustin L. Black,
RHCA

GlusterFS represents a dramatic departure from traditional backend
storage solutions. In this talk, Dustin will provide a technical dive
into GlusterFS from the SysAdmin perspective, with insights into the
building blocks of this dynamically-scalable storage system. Those new
to GlusterFS will walk away with the confidence to build their first
scale-out storage system, and those already familiar with the project
will benefit from this expanded view of bricks, translators, and
administration. Beyond the basics, we'll cover redundancy, scaling, and
data access, as well as real-world implementation scenarios.

*11:30 - 12:00* Special field trip TBD

*12:00 - 13:00* Lunch

*13:00 - 13:30* Survey of GlusterFS APIs

From managing Gluster volumes with oVirt, to developing mobile apps for
Gluster UFO, to developing translators in C or Python, there are many
ways to hack on GlusterFS. This talk will introduce the audience to the
myriad interfaces open to app developers and administrators.

*13:30 - 14:45* Converged Infrastructure, leveraging oVirt and Gluster
for fully virtualized environments - Theron Conrey

New virtualization features in Gluster 3.4 allow for more flexible and
more tightly integrated virtualization solutions. With the addition of
oVirt management functionality, Gluster and oVirt can help users today
deploy a more flexible virtualized infrastructure. We will discuss
setting up a GlusterFS volume with a block device translator, obtaining
the right versions of QEMU and libvirt, managing VMs with QEMU and using
the oVirt interface. This session will guide users through the steps
needed to set up a working virtualization environment.

*14:45 - 15:15* Demo: Debugging GlusterFS with Wireshark - Niels de Vos

Niels will demonstrate how Wireshark can be used to debug and visualize
details of GlusterFS operations on the network. This talk will show how
GlusterFS connects to storage servers and how viewing the requests and
responses the client and servers send helps to diagnose problems.

*15:15 - 15:30* Afternoon Break

*15:30 - 16:45* Hands On Development: Getting Started with GlusterFS
translators and GluPy - Kaleb Keithley

Kaleb Keithley, Senior Engineer at Red Hat, will introduce the audience
to the concept of translators, stackable modules in user space through
which control and data flows. Translators can be developed in C and
Python - and soon other languages. Kaleb will guide attendees through
the GlusterFS architecture, how features are implemented in translators,
and how developers can replace the GlusterFS stack and build entirely
new filesystems with translators.

*16:45 - 17:00* Closing Remarks

Speaker Biographies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dustin L. Black, Senior Technical Account Manager, Red Hat
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Dustin is a Red Hat Certified Architect and a senior member of Red Hat's
Global Support Services group. He has more than a decade of experience
in engineering complex systems to meet stringent business requirements.
He fully believes that his biggest assets are the smart people he
surrounds himself with, and he loves a good failure as an opportunity to
learn. As a TAM, Dustin provides named-resource support for open source
technologies to some of Red Hat's most demanding enterprise customers.
There's little he loves more than a creative implementation challenge,
and he geeks out on helping to turn community projects into world-class
solutions.

John Mark Walker, Gluster Community Lead, Red Hat
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

John Mark is an experienced veteran of all things open source and a
self-described agitprop, agitator and advocate for those who volunteer
countless, unpaid hours for a particular project or community. He first
fell down the slippery slope of open source as a web developer at VA
Linux Systems and eventually switched to the community team, beginning a
career that has now lasted over ten years. Along the way, John Mark made
stops at young, up-and-coming startups, such as Groundwork, Hyperic and
then Gluster (later acquired by Red Hat). His advice for companies who
want to "do community" is to trust your community with its own identify
and give them the space to try new things with the freedom to fail. John
Mark loves to perform community karaoke, and is available for weddings,
funerals and Bar/Bat Mitzvahs.

Kaleb Keithley, Senior Principal Software Engineer, Red Hat
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Kaleb works at Red Hat as one of the architects on the Red Hat Storage
development team. He spent several years at EMC working on Centera and
Atmos, he tried his luck at various start-ups including one
storage-related start-up, and before all of that he spent several years
working for the various incarnations of the X Consortium where he
incorporated FOSS operating systems such as Slackware Linux and FreeBSD
into the official build matrix. While at NASA's JPL he also produced a
couple of terrible hacks which he released as open source, one of which
continues to live to this day despite everyone's best efforts to kill it
off.

Niels de Vos, Senior Software Maintenance Engineer, Red Hat
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Niels works for the Support Engineering Group that is part of Red Hats
Global Support Services. His areas of interest include Red Hat Storage,
NFS and related technologies. He specializes in providing deep technical
knowledge, debugging/analysing problems customers are facing and
providing patches (bugfixes, backports, Feature Requests) to upstream
projects, such as GlusterFS, and for Red Hat Enterprise Linux packages.

Theron Conrey, open source and standards, Red Hat
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Theron is new to Red Hat and stayed busy before joining helping
organizations roll out hosted virtualization offerings in both private
and public facing configurations with Nexenta as a solutions engineer.
With diverse roles from turning wrenches at hosting companies to
managing and designing the virtualization infrastructure for a fortune
500 company, Theron has jumped feet first into all things oVirt at Red
Hat.
