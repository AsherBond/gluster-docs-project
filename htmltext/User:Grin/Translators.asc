Current Translator Status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here is a list of all known translators, with their current status and
maintainers. We will gradually add pages for each translator to more
easily track and participate in their development.

Translator Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Note: This list is not comprehensive and is a work in progress. This is
an attempt to offer architectural background and understanding.

Note to devs: If explanations of translator types listed here are not
correct, please update them accordingly. These are descriptions based on
best effort understanding of what has been published.
